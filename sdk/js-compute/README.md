# @fastly/js-compute

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@fastly/js-compute) ![npm downloads per month](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@fastly/js-compute)

Javascript SDK for building Fastly's [Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless) applications in Javascript.

This package also includes static, NPM installable releases for the `js-compute-runtime` CLI. This CLI allows for bundling JavaScript with the [Fastly Compute@Edge JS runtime](https://github.com/fastly/js-compute-runtime) into a Compute@Edge compatible WebAssembly service.

## Getting Started

We recommend using the [Fastly CLI](https://github.com/fastly/cli) to create, build, and deploy JavaScript Compute@Edge services, as [described on the Fastly Developer Hub](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/).

[Detailed documentation for JavaScript Compute@Edge services](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/javascript/) is also available on Fastly Developer Hub.

## Usage

### Javascript Examples

The Fastly Developer Hub has a collection of [common use cases in VCL ported to Javascript](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/migrate/), which also acts as a great set of introductory examples of using Javascript on Compute@Edge.

### API Reference

The API reference documentation for the Javascript SDK is hosted as a Fastly Compute@Edge application at [https://js-compute-reference-docs.edgecompute.app](https://js-compute-reference-docs.edgecompute.app).

## Security

If you find any security issues, see the [Fastly Security Reporting Page](https://www.fastly.com/security/report-security-issue) or send an email to: `security@fastly.com`

We plan to disclose any found security vulnerabilities per the [npm vulnerability reporting guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/reporting-a-vulnerability-in-an-npm-package). Note that communications related to security issues in Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Fastly security advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).
