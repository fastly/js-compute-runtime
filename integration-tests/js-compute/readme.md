# Writing Integration Tests for JS-Compute-Runtime

- Create a folder within [fixtures](./fixtures) which will contain the test Compute@Edge application
- Create a javascript or typescript file within the folder with the same name as the folder, this file should contain the test Compute@Edge application.
- Create a fastly.toml.in file which contains any backends that the application requires. This file should adhere to the format defined at <https://developer.fastly.com/reference/fastly-toml/>
- Create a tests.json file which following the format defined below.

## Fields in tests.json

tests.json is a file containing a JSON Object which contains all the test requests and assertions for the Compute@Edge application being tested.

The keys in the root object are used as the name of the tests.

### environments
An array of strings which states in what environments the test should run.
Valid strings which can be in the array are:
- 'viceroy' - This states that the test should run in the Viceroy environment.
- 'c@e' - This states that the test should run in the Compute@Edge environment.

### downstream_request
An Object which determines how the request to the test application should be configured.
The Object can contain the four properties:
- method
- pathname
- body
- headers

#### method
A string which is the name of the method that the request should use.
E.G. `"GET"` will make the request be a GET request.

#### pathname
A string which is the path and querystring that the request should use.
E.G. `"/"` will make the request go to `"/"` and `"/?colour=blue"` will make the request go to `"/?colour=blue"`.

#### body
A string which would be used as the request's body.

#### headers
An object which contains string keys and values that would each be used as a request header.
E.G. `{"a": "1", "b": "2" }` will set two headers on the request, a header named `a` with the value `1` and a header named `b` with the value `2`.

### local_upstream_requests
An Array of Objects which are used to assert against requests that the test application may have made during it's execution.
The Objects can contain the five properties:
- method
- pathname
- body
- headers
- timing

#### method
A string which is the name of the method to assert that the test application request has used during it's execution.
E.G. `"GET"` will assert that the upstream request was a GET request.

#### pathname
A string which is the path and querystring to assert that the test application request has used during it's execution.
E.G. `"/?colour=blue"` will assert that the upstream request was made to `"/?colour=blue"`.

#### body
A string which is the body to assert that the upstream request has used during it's execution.

#### headers
An object which contains string keys and values that would each be used as an assertion that the test application request has each header set during it's execution.
E.G. `{"a": "1", "b": "2" }` will assert that the upstream Request only has the headers named `a` with the value `1` and a header named `b` with the value `2`.

#### timing
A string set to `"afterDownstreamrequest"` to assert that the test application request happened after the downstream request.
If ommited, then no asserton will be made on when the upstream request happened.


### downstream_response
An Object which is used to assert against the response that the test application responded with.
The Object can contain the three properties:
- status
- body
- headers

#### status
A number which is the status to assert that the test application response has used.
E.G. `204` will assert that the response had a status set to 204.

#### body
A string or array which is the body to assert that the upstream request has used during it's execution.
If a string then the assertion is done on the entire response body.
If an array then assertions are done on each individual chunk received from response as a stream.

#### headers
An array which contains arrays, where each array contains two strings, the first is the header name and the second is the header value.
E.G. `{"a": "1", "b": "2" }` will assert that the response only has the headers named `a` with the value `1` and a header named `b` with the value `2`.

### logs
An array which contains strings used to assert against any logs emitted by the test application during it's execution.
E.G. `["ComputeLog :: Hello!"]` will assert that the application emitted a log-line containing only the string `"ComputeLog :: Hello!"`.


## Example tests.json file
```json
{
  "test for GET /example": {
    "environments": ["viceroy", "c@e"],
    "downstream_request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "pathname": "/example",
      "headers": [
        "food", "carrot"
      ]
    },
    "downstream_response": {
      "status": 200,
      "headers": [
        ["carrot", "yes"],
        ["potato", "no"]
      ],
      "body": "response from /example"
    },
    "local_upstream_requests": [
      {
        "method": "POST",
        "pathname": "/upstream-after-downstream",
        "headers": [
          ["test-header", "test-header-value"]
        ],
        "body": "pow wow",
        "timing": "afterDownstreamrequest"
      },
      {
        "method": "GET",
        "pathname": "/upstream"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
