# Use this script to run the wpt test harness locally. You'll need to have the
# following executables in your path:
#
# * wizer
# * npm
# * node
#
# From any directory, run this script and it will do the following:
#
# 1. build js-compute-runtime.wasm and move it into the current directory
# 2. build the wpt runner
# 3. run the test suite and forward any arguments to it
#
# If you'd like to run a debug build, set the `DEBUG` environment variable when
# running this script:
#
# > mkdir my_test
# > cd my_test
# > DEBUG=true ../tests/wpt-harness/run-wpt.sh
#
# For this to work, you'll need to have run the following command in advance:
#
# > cd c-dependencies/spidermonkey
# > ./download-engine.sh debug
#
# If you get an error about missing "jsapi.h" while building the runtime,
# something's gone wrong with the engine download.
