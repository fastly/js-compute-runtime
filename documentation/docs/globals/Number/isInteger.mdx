# Number.isInteger()

The **`Number.isInteger()`** method determines whether the passed value is an integer.

## Syntax

```js
Number.isInteger(value)
```

### Parameters

- `value`
  - : The value to be tested for being an integer.

### Return value

The boolean value `true` if the given value is an integer. Otherwise `false`.

## Description

If the target value is an integer, return `true`, otherwise return `false`. If the value is [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.md) or [`Infinity`](../../globals/Infinity.md), return `false`. The method will also return `true` for floating point numbers that can be represented as integer. It will always return `false` if the value is not a number.

Note that some number literals, while looking like non-integers, actually represent integers — due to the precision limit of ECMAScript floating-point number encoding (IEEE-754). For example, `5.0000000000000001` only differs from `5` by `1e-16`, which is too small to be represented. (For reference, [`Number.EPSILON`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/EPSILON) stores the distance between 1 and the next representable floating-point number greater than 1, and that is about `2.22e-16`.) Therefore, `5.0000000000000001` will be represented with the same encoding as `5`, thus making `Number.isInteger(5.0000000000000001)` return `true`.

In a similar sense, numbers around the magnitude of [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) will suffer from loss of precision and make `Number.isInteger` return `true` even when it's not an integer. (The actual threshold varies based on how many bits are needed to represent the decimal — for example, `Number.isInteger(4500000000000000.1)` is `true`, but `Number.isInteger(4500000000000000.5)` is `false`.)
