# Object.entries()

The **`Object.entries()`** method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.

## Syntax

```js
Object.entries(obj)
```

### Parameters

- `obj`
  - : An object.

### Return value

An array of the given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is an array with two elements: the first element is the property key (which is always a string), and the second element is the property value.

## Description

`Object.entries()` returns an array whose elements are arrays corresponding to the enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs found directly upon `object`. This is the same as iterating with a `for...in` loop, except that a `for...in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well. The order of the array returned by `Object.entries()` is the same as that provided by a `for...in` loop.

If you only need the property keys, use [`Object.keys()`](../../globals/Object/keys.md) instead. If you only need the property values, use [`Object.values()`](../../globals/Object/values.md) instead.
