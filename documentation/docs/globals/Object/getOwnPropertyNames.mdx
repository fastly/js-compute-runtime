# Object.getOwnPropertyNames()

The **`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`** method returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties except for those which use Symbol) found directly in a given object.

## Syntax

```js
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)
```

### Parameters

- `obj`
  - : The object whose enumerable and non-enumerable properties are to be returned.

### Return value

An array of strings that corresponds to the properties found directly in the given object.

## Description

`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable and non-enumerable properties found directly in a given object `obj`. The ordering of the enumerable properties in the array is consistent with the ordering exposed by a `for...in` loop (or by [`Object.keys()`](../../globals/Object/keys.md)) over the properties of the object. The non-negative integer keys of the object (both enumerable and non-enumerable) are added in ascending order to the array first, followed by the string keys in the order of insertion.
