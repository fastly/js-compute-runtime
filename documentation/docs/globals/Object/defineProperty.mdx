# Object.defineProperty()

The static method **`Object.defineProperty()`** defines a new
property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property on an object, and
returns the object.

## Syntax

```js
Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
```

### Parameters

- `obj`
  - : The object on which to define the property.
- `prop`
  - : The name or `Symbol` of the property to be defined or modified.
- `descriptor`
  - : The descriptor for the property being defined or modified.

### Return value

The object that was passed to the function.

## Description

This method allows a precise addition to or modification of a property on an object.
Normal property addition through assignment creates properties which show up during
property enumeration (`for...in` loop or
[`Object.keys`](../../globals/Object/keys.md) method), whose values may be changed, and which may be
deleted. This method allows these extra details
to be changed from their defaults. By default, properties added using
`Object.defineProperty()` are not writable, not enumerable, and not configurable.

Property descriptors present in objects come in two main flavors: data descriptors and
accessor descriptors. A **data descriptor** is a property that has a
value, which may or may not be writable. An **accessor descriptor** is a
property described by a getter-setter pair of functions. A descriptor must be one of
these two flavors; it cannot be both.

Both data and accessor descriptors are objects. They share the following optional keys
(please note: the **defaults** mentioned here are in the case of defining
properties using `Object.defineProperty()`):

- `configurable`

  - : when this is set to `false`,

    - the type of this property cannot be changed between data property and accessor property, and
    - the property may not be deleted, and
    - other attributes of its descriptor cannot be changed (however, if it's a data descriptor with `writable: true`, the `value` can be changed, and `writable` can be changed to `false`).

    **Defaults to `false`.**

- `enumerable`
  - : `true` if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of the
    properties on the corresponding object.
    **Defaults to `false`.**

A **data descriptor** also has the following optional keys:

- `value`
  - : The value associated with the property. Can be any valid JavaScript value (number,
    object, function, etc.).
    **Defaults to [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md).**
- `writable`
  - : `true` if the value associated with the property may be changed with an
    assignment operator.
    **Defaults to `false`.**

An **accessor descriptor** also has the following optional keys:

- `get`
  - : A function which serves as a getter for the property, or [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md) if
    there is no getter. When the property is accessed, this function is called without
    arguments and with `this` set to the object through which the property is
    accessed (this may not be the object on which the property is defined due to
    inheritance). The return value will be used as the value of the property.
    **Defaults to [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md).**
- `set`
  - : A function which serves as a setter for the property, or [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md) if
    there is no setter. When the property is assigned, this function is called with one
    argument (the value being assigned to the property) and with `this` set to
    the object through which the property is assigned.
    **Defaults to [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md).**

If a descriptor has neither of `value`, `writable`,
`get` and `set` keys, it is treated as a data descriptor. If a
descriptor has both \[`value` or `writable`] and \[`get` or `set`] keys, an exception is thrown.

Bear in mind that these attributes are not necessarily the descriptor's own properties.
Inherited properties will be considered as well. In order to ensure these defaults are
preserved, you might freeze existing objects in the descriptor object's prototype chain upfront, specify all
options explicitly, or point to [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) with [`Object.create(null)`](../../globals/Object/create.md).

```js
const obj = {};
// 1. Using a null prototype: no inherited properties
const descriptor = Object.create(null);
descriptor.value = 'static';

// not enumerable, not configurable, not writable as defaults
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'key', descriptor);

// 2. Being explicit by using a throw-away object literal with all attributes present
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'key2', {
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: false,
  writable: false,
  value: 'static'
});

// 3. Recycling same object
function withValue(value) {
  const d = withValue.d || (
    withValue.d = {
      enumerable: false,
      writable: false,
      configurable: false,
      value,
    }
  );

  // avoiding duplicate operation for assigning value
  if (d.value !== value) d.value = value;

  return d;
}
// and
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'key', withValue('static'));

// if freeze is available, prevents adding or
// removing the object prototype properties
// (value, get, set, enumerable, writable, configurable)
(Object.freeze || Object)(Object.prototype);
```

When the property already exists, `Object.defineProperty()` attempts to modify the property according to the values in the descriptor and the property's current configuration.

If the old descriptor had its `configurable` attribute set to `false`, the property is said to be _non-configurable_. It is not possible to change any attribute of a non-configurable accessor property, and it is not possible to switch between data and accessor property types. For data properties with `writable: true`, it is possible to modify the value and change the `writable` attribute from `true` to `false`. A [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.md) is thrown when attempts are made to change non-configurable property attributes (except `value` and `writable`, if permitted), except when defining a value same as the original value on a data property.

When the current property is configurable, defining an attribute to `undefined` effectively deletes it. For example, if `o.k` is an accessor property, `Object.defineProperty(o, "k", { set: undefined })` will remove the setter, making `k` only have a getter and become readonly. If an attribute is absent from the new descriptor, the old descriptor attribute's value is kept (it won't be implicitly re-defined to `undefined`). It is possible to toggle between data and accessor property by giving a descriptor of a different "flavor". For example, if the new descriptor is a data descriptor (with `value` or `writable`), the original descriptor's `get` and `set` attributes will both be dropped.
