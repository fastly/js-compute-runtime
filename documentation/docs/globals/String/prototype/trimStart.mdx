# String.prototype.trimStart()

The **`trimStart()`** method removes whitespace from the beginning of a string and returns a new string, without modifying the original string. `trimLeft()` is an alias of this method.

## Syntax

```js
trimStart()

trimLeft()
```

### Return value

A new string representing `str` stripped of whitespace from its beginning (left side). Whitespace is defined as [white space](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#white_space) characters plus [line terminators](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#line_terminators).

If the beginning of `str` has no whitespace, a new string is still returned (essentially a copy of `str`).

### Aliasing

After [`String.prototype.trim()`](../../../globals/String/prototype/trim.md) was standardized, engines also implemented the non-standard method `trimLeft`. However, for consistency with [`String.prototype.padEnd()`](../../../globals/String/prototype/padEnd.md), when the method got standardized, its name was chosen as `trimStart`. For web compatibility reasons, `trimLeft` remains as an alias to `trimStart`, and they refer to the exact same function object. In some engines this means:

```js
String.prototype.trimLeft.name === "trimStart";
```
