# String.prototype.slice()

The **`slice()`** method extracts a section of a string and
returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.

## Syntax

```js
slice(indexStart)
slice(indexStart, indexEnd)
```

### Parameters

- `indexStart`
  - : The index of the first character to include in the returned substring.
- `indexEnd` _**optional**_
  - : The index of the first character to exclude from the returned substring.

### Return value

A new string containing the extracted section of the string.

## Description

`slice()` extracts the text from one string and returns a new string. Changes to the text in one string do not affect the other string.

`slice()` extracts up to but not including `indexEnd`. For example, `str.slice(1, 4)` extracts the second character through the fourth character (characters indexed `1`, `2`, and `3`).

- If `indexStart >= str.length`, an empty string is returned.
- If `indexStart < 0`, the index is counted from the end of the string. More formally, in this case, the substring starts at `max(indexStart + str.length, 0)`.
- If `indexStart` is omitted, undefined, or cannot be converted to a number (using [`Number()`](../../../globals/Number/Number.md)), it's treated as `0`.
- If `indexEnd` is omitted, undefined, or cannot be converted to a number (using [`Number()`](../../../globals/Number/Number.md)), or if `indexEnd >= str.length`, `slice()` extracts to the end of the string.
- If `indexEnd < 0`, the index is counted from the end of the string. More formally, in this case, the substring ends at `max(indexEnd + str.length, 0)`.
- If `indexEnd <= indexStart` after normalizing negative values (i.e. `indexEnd` represents a character that's before `indexStart`), an empty string is returned.
