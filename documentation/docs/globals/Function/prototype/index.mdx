# Function.prototype.prototype

The **`prototype`** data property of a `Function` instance is used when the function is used as a constructor with the `new` operator. It will become the new object's prototype.

> **Note:** Not all `Function` objects have the `prototype` property — see [description](#description).

## Value

An object.

> **Note:** The `prototype` property of [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) is not writable.

## Description

When a function is called with `new`, the constructor's `prototype` property will become the resulting object's prototype.

```js
function Ctor() {}
const inst = new Ctor();
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(inst) === Ctor.prototype); // true
```

You can read [Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain#constructors) for more information about the interactions between a constructor function's `prototype` property and the resulting object's prototype.

A function having a `prototype` property is not sufficient for it to be eligible as a constructor. [Generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) have a `prototype` property, but cannot be called with `new`:

```js
async function* asyncGeneratorFunction() {}
function* generatorFunction() {}
```

Instead, generator functions' `prototype` property is used when they are called _without_ `new`. The `prototype` property will become the returned [`Generator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) object's prototype.

In addition, some functions may have a `prototype` but throw unconditionally when called with `new`. For example, the [`Symbol()`](../../../globals/Symbol/Symbol.md) and [`BigInt`](../../../globals/BigInt/BigInt.md) functions throw when called with `new`, because `Symbol.prototype` and `BigInt.prototype` are only intended to provide methods for the primitive values, but the wrapper objects should not be directly constructed.

The following functions do not have `prototype`, and are therefore ineligible as constructors, even if a `prototype` property is later manually assigned:

```js
const method = { foo() {} }.foo;
const arrowFunction = () => {};
async function asyncFunction() {}
```

The following are valid constructors that have `prototype`:

```js
class Class {}
function fn() {}
```

A [bound function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) does not have a `prototype` property, but may be constructable. When it's constructed, the target function is constructed instead, and if the target function is constructable, it would return a normal instance.

```js
const boundFunction = function () {}.bind(null);
```

A function's `prototype` property, by default, is a plain object with one property: (`constructor`)[../../../globals/Object/prototype/constructor.md), which is a reference to the function itself. The `constructor` property is writable, non-enumerable, and configurable.

If the `prototype` of a function is reassigned with something other than an `Object`, when the function is called with `new`, the returned object's prototype would be `Object.prototype` instead. (In other words, `new` ignores the `prototype` property and constructs a plain object.)

```js
function Ctor() {}
Ctor.prototype = 3;
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(new Ctor()) === Object.prototype); // true
```
