# FetchEvent.waitUntil()


The **`waitUntil()`** method tells the host environment that work is ongoing until the promise settles, and it shouldn't terminate
the application if it wants that work to complete.

The `waitUntil()` method must be initially called within the event callback,
but after that it can be called multiple times, until all the promises passed to it
settle.

## Syntax

```js
waitUntil(promise)
```

### Parameters

A [`Promise`](../../Promise/Promise.mdx).

### Return value

None `undefined`.
