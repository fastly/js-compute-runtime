# Array.prototype.reduceRight()

The **`reduceRight()`** method applies a function against an
accumulator and each value of the array (from right-to-left) to reduce it to a single
value.

See also [`Array.prototype.reduce()`](./reduce.md) for left-to-right.

## Syntax

```js
// Arrow function
reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue) => { /* … */ })
reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue, index) => { /* … */ })
reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => { /* … */ })
reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => { /* … */ }, initialValue)

// Callback function
reduceRight(callbackFn)
reduceRight(callbackFn, initialValue)

// Callback reducer function
reduceRight(function (accumulator, currentValue) { /* … */ })
reduceRight(function (accumulator, currentValue, index) { /* … */ })
reduceRight(function (accumulator, currentValue, index, array) { /* … */ })
reduceRight(function (accumulator, currentValue, index, array) { /* … */ }, initialValue)
```

### Parameters

- `callbackFn`

  - : A function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value becomes the value of the `accumulator` parameter on the next invocation of `callbackFn`. For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return value of `reduce()`.

    The function is called with the following arguments:

    - `accumulator`
      - : The value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or
        `initialValue`, if supplied. (See below.)
    - `currentValue`
      - : The current element being processed in the array.
    - `index`
      - : The index of the current element being processed in the array.
    - `array`
      - : The array `reduceRight()` was called upon.

- `initialValue` _**optional**_
  - : Value to use as accumulator to the first call of the
    `callbackFn`. If no initial value is supplied, the last element in
    the array will be used and skipped. Calling reduce or reduceRight on an empty array
    without an initial value creates a `TypeError`.

### Return value

The value that results from the reduction.

## Description

The `reduceRight()` method is an iterative method. It runs a "reducer" callback function over all elements in the array, in descending-index order, and accumulates them into a single value.

`callbackFn` is invoked only for array indexes which have assigned values. It is not invoked for empty slots in sparse arrays.

Unlike other [iterative methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#iterative_methods), `reduce()` does not accept a `thisArg` argument. `callbackFn` is always called with `undefined` as `this`, which gets substituted with `globalThis` if `callbackFn` is non-strict.

`reduceRight()` does not mutate the array on which it is called, but the function provided as `callbackFn` can. Note, however, that the length of the array is saved _before_ the first invocation of `callbackFn`. Therefore:

- `callbackFn` will not visit any elements added beyond the array's initial length when the call to `reduceRight()` began.
- Changes to already-visited indexes do not cause `callbackFn` to be invoked on them again.
- If an existing, yet-unvisited element of the array is changed by `callbackFn`, its value passed to the `callbackFn` will be the value at the time that element gets visited. [Deleted](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) elements are not visited.



The `reduceRight()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.
