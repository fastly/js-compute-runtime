# Array.prototype.push()

The **`push()`** method adds one or more elements to the end of
an array and returns the new length of the array.

## Syntax

```js
push(element0)
push(element0, element1)
push(element0, element1, /* … ,*/ elementN)
```

### Parameters

- `elementN`
  - : The element(s) to add to the end of the array.

### Return value

The new [`Array.prototype.length`](./length.md) property of the object upon which the method was called.

## Description

The `push()` method appends values to an array.

[`Array.prototype.unshift()`](./unshift.md)has similar behavior to `push()`, but applied to the start of an array.

The `push()` method is a mutating method. It changes the length and the content of `this`. In case you want the value of `this` to be the same, but return a new array with elements appended to the end, you can use [`arr.concat([element0, element1, /* ... ,*/ elementN])`](./concat.md) instead. Notice that the elements are wrapped in an extra array — otherwise, if the element is an array itself, it would be spread instead of pushed as a single element due to the behavior of `concat()`.

The `push()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties. Although strings are also array-like, this method is not suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable.
