# Set.prototype.forEach()

The **`forEach()`** method executes a provided function once
for each value in the `Set` object, in insertion order.

## Syntax

```js
// Arrow function
forEach(() => { /* ... */ } )
forEach((value) => { /* ... */ } )
forEach((value, key) => { /* ... */ } )
forEach((value, key, set) => { /* ... */ } )

// Callback function
forEach(callbackFn)
forEach(callbackFn, thisArg)

// Inline callback function
forEach(function() { /* ... */ })
forEach(function(value) { /* ... */ })
forEach(function(value, key) { /* ... */ })
forEach(function(value, key, set) { /* ... */ })
forEach(function(value, key, set) { /* ... */ }, thisArg)
```

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function to execute for each element, taking three arguments:

    - `value`, `key`
      - : The current element being processed in the `Set`. As there are no
        keys in `Set`, the value is passed for both arguments.
    - `set`
      - : The `Set` object which `forEach()` was called upon.

- `thisArg`
  - : Value to use as `this` when executing `callbackFn`.

### Return value

[`undefined`](../../../globals/undefined.md).

## Description

The `forEach()` method executes the provided
`callback` once for each value which actually exists in the
`Set` object. It is not invoked for values which have been deleted. However,
it is executed for values which are present but have the value `undefined`.

`callback` is invoked with **three arguments**:

- the **element value**
- the **element key**
- the **`Set` object being traversed**

There are no keys in `Set` objects, however, so the first two arguments are
both **values** contained in the [Set](../../../globals/Set/Set.md). This is to make it
consistent with other `forEach()` methods for [`Map.prototype.forEach()`](../../../globals/Map/prototype/forEach.md) and [`Array.prototype.forEach()`](../../../globals/Array/prototype/forEach.md).

If a `thisArg` parameter is provided to `forEach()`,
it will be passed to `callback` when invoked, for use as its
`this` value. Otherwise, the value `undefined` will be passed for
use as its `this` value. The `this` value ultimately observable by
`callback` is determined according to
[the usual rules for determining the `this` seen by a function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).

Each value is visited once, except in the case when it was deleted and re-added before
`forEach()` has finished. `callback` is not invoked for
values deleted before being visited. New values added before `forEach()` has
finished will be visited.

`forEach()` executes the `callback` function once for
each element in the `Set` object; it does not return a value.
