# enforceExplicitBackends

Call this function to enforce the security property of explicitly-defined backends, even when dynamic backends are enabled at
the Fastly service level.

By default, if dynamic backends are supported for the Fastly service, they will be automatically used when creating a new
`fetch()` request. This default behaviour for dynamic backends can be a potential security concern since third-party JavaScript
code may send arbitrary requests, including sensitive/secret data, off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not
intending.

When calling this function, an optional default backend name can be provided.

>**Note**: This is a separate option to the service-level dynamic backend support for Fastly services.

By default, dynamic backends are disabled for Fastly Services, so that even if not using this
function, the service-level security configuration will apply.

   @param defaultBackend the name of the default backend to use, when using {@link fetch | fetch()}.


The **`enforceExplicitBackends()`** function is used to control whether or not Dynamic Backends should be allowed within this Fastly Compute Service.

By default, Dynamic Backends are enabled, but can be a potential security concern since third-party JavaScript code may send arbitrary requests, potentially including sensitive/secret data, off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not intending.

Using `allowDynamicBackends(false)` this security property can be restored to only use explicit backend definitions.

>**Note**: Dynamic Backends are disabled by default for Fastly Services. Please contact [Fastly Support](https://support.fastly.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000269711) to request the feature be enabled or disabled on Fastly Services.
