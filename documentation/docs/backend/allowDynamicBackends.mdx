# allowDynamicBackends

The **`allowDynamicBackends()`** function is used to control whether or not Dynamic Backends should be allowed within this Fastly Compute Service.

By default, Dynamic Backends are enabled, but can be a potential security concern since third-party JavaScript code may send arbitrary requests, potentially including sensitive/secret data, off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not intending.

Using `allowDynamicBackends(false)` this security property can be restored to only use explicit backend definitions.

>**Note**: Dynamic Backends are disabled by default for Fastly Services. Please contact [Fastly Support](https://support.fastly.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000269711) to request the feature be enabled or disabled on Fastly Services.

## Syntax

```js
allowDynamicBackends(enabledOrConfig)
```

### Parameters

- `enabled` _: boolean_
  - Whether or not to allow Dynamic Backends

### Return value

`undefined`.
