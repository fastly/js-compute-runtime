# allowDynamicBackends

:::info

This method is deprecated, and dynamic backends are now always supported when enabled at the service level. See [`enforceExplicitBackends`](./enforceExplicitBackends.mdx) instead.

:::

The **`allowDynamicBackends()`** function is used to control whether or not Dynamic Backends should be allowed within this Fastly Compute Service.

By default, Dynamic Backends are enabled, but can be a potential security concern since third-party JavaScript code may send arbitrary requests, potentially including sensitive/secret data, off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not intending.

Using `allowDynamicBackends(false)` this security property can be restored to only use explicit backend definitions.

>**Note**: By default, while dynamic backends are allowed in the SDK, they are by default disabled at the Fastly service level.

## Syntax

```js
allowDynamicBackends(enabledOrConfig)
```

### Parameters

- `enabled` _: boolean_
  - Whether or not to allow Dynamic Backends

### Return value

`undefined`.
