# Set.prototype.entries()

The **`entries()`** method returns a new [Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators) object
that contains **an array of `[value, value]`** for each element
in the `Set` object, in insertion order. For `Set` objects there
is no `key` like in `Map` objects. However, to keep the API
similar to the `Map` object, each _entry_ has the same value for its
_key_ and _value_ here, so that an array `[value, value]` is
returned.

## Syntax

```js
entries()
```

### Return value

A new iterator object that contains an array of `[value, value]` for each
element in the given `Set`, in insertion order.
