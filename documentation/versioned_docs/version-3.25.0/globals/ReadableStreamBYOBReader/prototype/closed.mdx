# closed

The **`closed`** read-only property of the `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` interface returns a `Promise` that fulfills when the stream closes, or rejects if the stream throws an error or the reader's lock is released.

This property enables you to write code that responds to an end to the streaming process.

## Value

A `Promise`.
