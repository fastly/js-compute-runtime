# Math.log()

The **`Math.log()`** function returns the natural logarithm (base [E](./E.mdx)) of a number.

## Syntax

```js
Math.log(x)
```

### Parameters

- `x`
  - : A number greater than or equal to 0.

### Return value

The natural logarithm (base [E](./E.mdx)) of `x`. If `x` is Â±0, returns [`-Infinity`](../Number/NEGATIVE_INFINITY.mdx). If `x < 0`, returns `NaN`.

## Description

Because `log()` is a static method of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.log()`, rather than as a method of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).

If you need the natural log of 2 or 10, use the constants `Math.LN2` or `Math.LN10`. If you need a logarithm to base 2 or 10, use `Math.log2()` or `Math.log10()`. If you need a logarithm to other bases, use `Math.log(x) / Math.log(otherBase)` as in the example below; you might want to precalculate `1 / Math.log(otherBase)` since multiplication in `Math.log(x) * constant` is much faster.

Beware that positive numbers very close to 1 can suffer from loss of precision and make its natural logarithm less accurate. In this case, you may want to use `Math.log1p` instead.
