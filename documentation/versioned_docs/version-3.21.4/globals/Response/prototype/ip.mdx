# Response.ip

The **`ip`** getter of the `Response` interface returns the IP address associated with the request, as either an IPv6 or IPv4 string.

In the case where no IP address is available (say the response is cached, or was manually created), `undefined` will be returned.

To ensure an origin request with an IP, pass a [`CacheOverride`](../../../fastly:cache-override/CacheOverride/CacheOverride.mdx) value.

## Value

`undefined` or `string`.
