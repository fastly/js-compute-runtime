# encodeURI()

The **`encodeURI()`** function encodes a URI by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two surrogate characters). Compared to [`encodeURIComponent()`](./encodeURIComponent.mdx), this function encodes fewer characters, preserving those that are part of the URI syntax.

## Syntax

```js
encodeURI(uri)
```

### Parameters

- `uri`
  - : A string to be encoded as a URI.

### Return value

A new string representing the provided string encoded as a URI.

### Exceptions

- [`URIError`](./URIError/URIError.mdx)
  - : Thrown if `uri` contains a [lone surrogate](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_codepoints_and_grapheme_clusters).

## Description

`encodeURI()` is a function property of the global object.

The `encodeURI()` function escapes characters by UTF-8 code units, with each octet encoded in the format `%XX`, left-padded with 0 if necessary. Because lone surrogates in UTF-16 do not encode any valid Unicode character, they cause `encodeURI()` to throw a [`URIError`](./URIError/URIError.mdx).

`encodeURI()` escapes all characters **except**:

```
A–Z a–z 0–9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )

; / ? : @ & = + $ , #
```

The characters on the second line are characters that may be part of the URI syntax, and are only escaped by `encodeURIComponent()`. Both `encodeURI()` and `encodeURIComponent()` do not encode the characters `-.!~*'()`, known as "unreserved marks", which do not have a reserved purpose but are allowed in a URI "as is". (See [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt))

The `encodeURI()` function does not encode characters that have special meaning (reserved characters) for a URI. The following example shows all the parts that a URI can possibly contain. Note how certain characters are used to signify special meaning:

```
http://username:password@www.example.com:80/path/to/file.php?foo=316&bar=this+has+spaces#anchor
```
