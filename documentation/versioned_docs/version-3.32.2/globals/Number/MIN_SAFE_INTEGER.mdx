# Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER

The **`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`** constant represents the minimum safe integer in JavaScript, or -(2<sup>53</sup> - 1).

To represent integers smaller than this, consider using `BigInt`.

## Value

`-9007199254740991` (-9,007,199,254,740,991, or about -9 quadrillion).

## Description

[Double precision floating point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format) only has 52 bits to represent the [mantissa](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#number_encoding), so it can only safely represent integers between -(2<sup>53</sup> – 1) and 2<sup>53</sup> – 1. Safe in this context refers to the ability to represent integers exactly and to correctly compare them. For example, `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER - 1 === Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER - 2` will evaluate to true, which is mathematically incorrect. See `Number.isSafeInteger()` for more information.

Because `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` is a static property of `Number`, you always use it as `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`, rather than as a property of a number value.
