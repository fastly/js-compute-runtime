# EcKeyImportParams

The **`EcKeyImportParams`** dictionary represents the object that should be passed as the `algorithm` parameter into `SubtleCrypto.importKey()`, when generating any elliptic-curve-based key pair: that is, when the algorithm is identified as ECDSA.

## Instance properties

- `name`
  - : A string. This should be set to `ECDSA`.
- `namedCurve`

  - : A string representing the name of the elliptic curve to use. This may be any of the following names for [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)-approved curves:

    - `P-256`
    - `P-384`
    - `P-521`
