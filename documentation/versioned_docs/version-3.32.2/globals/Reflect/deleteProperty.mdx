# Reflect.deleteProperty()

The static
**`Reflect.deleteProperty()`**
method allows to delete properties. It is like the
[`delete` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete)
as a function.

## Syntax

```js
Reflect.deleteProperty(target, propertyKey)
```

### Parameters

- `target`
  - : The target object on which to delete the property.
- `propertyKey`
  - : The name of the property to be deleted.

### Return value

A `Boolean` indicating whether or not the property was successfully
deleted.

### Exceptions

A [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.mdx), if `target` is not an
`Object`.

## Description

The `Reflect.deleteProperty` method allows you to delete a property on an
object. It returns a `Boolean` indicating whether or not the property was
successfully deleted. It is almost identical to the non-strict
[`delete` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete).
