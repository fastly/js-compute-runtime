# ByteLengthQueuingStrategy()

The **`ByteLengthQueuingStrategy()`**
constructor creates and returns a `ByteLengthQueuingStrategy` object
instance.

## Syntax

```js
new ByteLengthQueuingStrategy(highWaterMark)
```

### Parameters

An object with the following property:

- `highWaterMark`

  - : The total number of bytes that can be contained in the internal queue before backpressure is applied.

    Unlike `CountQueuingStrategy()` where the `highWaterMark` parameter specifies a simple count of the number of chunks, with `ByteLengthQueuingStrategy()`, the `highWaterMark` parameter specifies a number of _bytes_ â€” specifically, given a stream of chunks, how many bytes worth of those chunks (rather than a count of how many of those chunks) can be contained in the internal queue before backpressure is applied.

### Return value

An instance of the `ByteLengthQueuingStrategy` object.
