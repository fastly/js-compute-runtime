# Math.LN10

The **`Math.LN10`** property represents the natural logarithm of 10, approximately 2.302.

## Value

`2.302585092994046`

## Description

Because `LN10` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.LN10`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
