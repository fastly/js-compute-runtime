# Math.E

The **`Math.E`** property represents Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms, e, which is approximately 2.718.

## Value

`2.718281828459045`

## Description

Because `E` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.E`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
