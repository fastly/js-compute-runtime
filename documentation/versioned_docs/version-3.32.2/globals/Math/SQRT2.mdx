# Math.SQRT2

The **`Math.SQRT2`** property represents the square root of 2, approximately 1.414.

## Value

`0.7071067811865476`

## Description

`Math.SQRT2` is a constant and a more performant equivalent to [`Math.sqrt(2)`](./sqrt.mdx).

Because `SQRT2` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.SQRT2`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
