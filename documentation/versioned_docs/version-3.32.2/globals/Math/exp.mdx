# Math.exp()

The **`Math.exp()`** function returns [E](./E.mdx) raised to the power of a number.

## Syntax

```js
Math.exp(x)
```

### Parameters

- `x`
  - : A number.

### Return value

A nonnegative number representing e<sup>x</sup>, where e is [the base of the natural logarithm](./E.mdx).

## Description

Because `exp()` is a static method of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.exp()`, rather than as a method of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).

Beware that `e` to the power of a number very close to 0 will be very close to 1 and suffer from loss of precision. In this case, you may want to use `Math.expm1` instead, and obtain a much higher-precision fractional part of the answer.
