# Math.LOG10E

The **`Math.LOG10E`** property represents the base 10 logarithm of [E](./E.mdx), approximately 0.434.

## Value

`0.4342944819032518`

## Description

Because `LOG10E` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.LOG10E`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
