# Math.LN2

The **`Math.LN2`** property represents the natural logarithm of 2, approximately 0.693:

## Value

`0.6931471805599453`

## Description

Because `LN2` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.LN2`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
