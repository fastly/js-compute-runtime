# ReadableStream.pipeThrough()

The **`pipeThrough()`** method of the `ReadableStream` interface provides a chainable way of piping the current stream through a transform stream or any other writable/readable pair.

Piping a stream will generally lock it for the duration of the pipe, preventing other readers from locking it.

## Syntax

```js
pipeThrough(transformStream)
pipeThrough(transformStream, options)
```

### Parameters

- `transformStream`

  - : A `TransformStream` (or an object with the structure
    `{writable, readable}`) consisting of a readable stream and a writable
    stream working together to transform some data from one form to another. Data written
    to the `writable` stream can be read in some transformed state by the
    `readable` stream. For example, a `TextDecoder`, has bytes
    written to it and strings read from it, while a video decoder has encoded bytes
    written to it and uncompressed video frames read from it.

- `options` _**optional**_

  - : The options that should be used when piping to the `writable` stream.
    Available options are:

    - `preventClose`

      - : If this is set to `true`, the source `ReadableStream` closing will no longer cause the destination `WritableStream` to be closed.
        The method will return a fulfilled promise once this process completes, unless an error is encountered while closing the destination, in which case it will be rejected with that error.

    - `preventAbort`

      - : If this is set to `true`, errors in the source `ReadableStream` will no longer abort the destination `WritableStream`.
        The method will return a promise rejected with the source's error, or with any error that occurs during aborting the destination.

    - `preventCancel`

      - : If this is set to `true`, errors in the destination `WritableStream` will no longer cancel the source `ReadableStream`.
        In this case the method will return a promise rejected with the source's error, or with any error that occurs during canceling the source.
        In addition, if the destination writable stream starts out closed or closing, the source readable stream will no longer be canceled.
        In this case the method will return a promise rejected with an error indicating piping to a closed stream failed, or with any error that occurs during canceling the source.

### Return value

The `readable` side of the `transformStream`.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the `writable` and/or `readable` property of `transformStream` are undefined.
