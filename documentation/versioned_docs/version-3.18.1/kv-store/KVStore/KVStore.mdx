# `KVStore()`

The **`KVStore` constructor** lets you connect your Fastly Compute application to a Fastly KV store.

A Fastly KV store is a persistent, globally consistent key-value store. See [Data stores for Fastly services](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/concepts/edge-state/data-stores#kv-stores) for initialization and usage details.

>**Note**: Can only be used when processing requests, not during build-time initialization.

## Syntax

```js
new KVStore(name)
```

> **Note:** `KVStore()` can only be constructed with `new`. Attempting to call it without `new` throws a [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.mdx).

### Parameters

- `name` _: string_
  - The Fastly KV store which should be associated with this KVStore instance
  
### Return value

A new `KVStore` object.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - Thrown if no KV Store exists with the provided name
  - Thrown if the provided name is longer than 255 in length
  - Thrown if the provided name is an empty string
  - Thrown if the provided name does not start with an ascii alphabetical character 
  - Thrown if the provided name contains control characters `(\u0000-\u001F)`

## Examples

In this example we connect to an KV Store named `'files'` and save an entry to the store under the key `'hello'` and then read back the value and return it to the client.

```js
/// <reference types="@fastly/js-compute" />

import { KVStore } from "fastly:kv-store";

async function app(event) {
  const files = new KVStore('files')

  await files.put('hello', 'world')

  const entry = await files.get('hello')

  return new Response(await entry.text())
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(app(event)))

```
