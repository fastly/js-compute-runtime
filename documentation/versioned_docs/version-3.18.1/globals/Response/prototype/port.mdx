# Response.port

The **`port`** getter of the `Response` interface returns the port associated with the request, as a number.

In the case where no port is available (say the response is cached, or was manually created), `undefined` will be returned.

To ensure an origin request with a port, pass a [`CacheOverride`](../../../cache-override/CacheOverride/CacheOverride.mdx) value.

## Value

`undefined` or `number`.
