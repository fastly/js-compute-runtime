# Shield.prototype.encryptedBackend

▸ **encryptedBackend**(): `Backend`

Returns a `Backend` representing an encrypted connection to the POP.

For reference, this is almost always the backend that you want to use. Only use [`Shield::unencryptedBackend`](./unencryptedBackend.mdx) in situations in which you are 100% sure that all the data you will send and receive over the backend is already encrypted.
