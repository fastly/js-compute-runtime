# Response.setManualFramingHeaders()

The **`setManualFramingHeaders()`** method of the `Response` interface controls how the framing headers should be determined.

By default the framing headers are set to "automatic" mode, which means they are created based on the body of the associated Response instance.
In "automatic" mode, a `Content-Length` is used when the size of the body can be determined before it is sent.
Responses sent in streaming mode, where headers are sent immediately but the content of the body is streamed later, will receive a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to accommodate the dynamic generation of the body.
In "manual" mode, any `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` headers will be honored.
You must ensure that those headers have correct values permitted by the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.1).
If the provided headers are not permitted by the specification, the headers will revert to "automatic" mode and a diagnostic message will be logged about what was wrong.
If a `Content-Length` is permitted by the specification, but the value does not match the size of the actual body, the body will either be truncated (if it is too long), or the connection will be hung up early (if it is too short).
