# Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY

The **`Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`** property represents the negative Infinity value.

## Value

The same as the negative value of the global [`Infinity`](../../globals/Infinity.mdx) property.

## Description

The `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity:

- Any positive value, including `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, multiplied by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
- Any negative value, including `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, multiplied by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
- Any positive value divided by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [negative zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero) (as defined in [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)).
- Any negative value divided by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [positive zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero) (as defined in [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)).
- Zero multiplied by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.mdx).
- [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.mdx) multiplied by `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.mdx).
- `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any negative value except `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, is `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
- `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any positive value except `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, is `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
- `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by either `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` or `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, is [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.mdx).
- `x > Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is true for any number _x_ that isn't `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.

You might use the `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` property to indicate an error condition that returns a finite number in case of success. Note, however, that [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.mdx) would be more appropriate in such a case.

Because `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is a static property of `Number`, you always use it as `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, rather than as a property of a number value.
