# String() constructor

The **`String`** constructor is used to create a new
`String` object. When called instead as a function, it performs type
conversion to a "primitive string" which is usually more
useful.

## Syntax

```js
new String(thing)
String(thing)
```

> **Note:** `String()` can be called with or without `new`, but with different effects. See [Return value](#return_value).

### Parameters

- `thing`
  - : Anything to be converted to a string.

### Return value

When `String` is called as a constructor (with `new`), it creates a `String` object, which is **not** a primitive.

When `String` is called as a function, it coerces the parameter to a string primitive. `Symbol` values would be converted to `"Symbol(description)"`, where `description` is the [description](../../globals/Symbol/prototype/description.mdx) of the Symbol, instead of throwing.

> **Warning:** You should rarely find yourself using `String` as a constructor.
