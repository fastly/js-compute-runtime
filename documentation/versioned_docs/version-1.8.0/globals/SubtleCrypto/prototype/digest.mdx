# digest()

The **`digest()`** method of the [`SubtleCrypto`](../SubtleCrypto.mdx)
interface generates a digest of the given data. A digest is a short
fixed-length value derived from some variable-length input. Cryptographic digests should
exhibit collision-resistance, meaning that it's hard to come up with two different
inputs that have the same digest value.

It takes as its arguments an identifier for the digest algorithm to use and the data to
digest. It returns a [`Promise`](../../Promise/Promise.mdx) which will be fulfilled with the digest.

## Syntax

```js
digest(algorithm, data)
```

### Parameters

- `algorithm`
  - : This may be a string or an object with a single property `name` that is a string. The string names the hash function to use. Supported values are:
    - `"SHA-1"` (but don't use this in cryptographic applications)
    - `"SHA-256"`
    - `"SHA-384"`
    - `"SHA-512"`.
- `data`
  - : An `ArrayBuffer`, a `TypedArray` or a `DataView` object containing the data to be digested.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](../../Promise/Promise.mdx) that fulfills with an `ArrayBuffer` containing the digest.

## Supported algorithms

Digest algorithms, also known as cryptographic hash functions,
transform an arbitrarily large block of data into a fixed-size output,
usually much shorter than the input. They have a variety of applications in
cryptography.
