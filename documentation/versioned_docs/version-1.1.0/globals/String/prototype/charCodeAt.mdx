# String.prototype.charCodeAt()

The **`charCodeAt()`** method returns
an integer between `0` and `65535` representing the UTF-16 code
unit at the given index.

The UTF-16 code unit matches the Unicode code point for code points which can be
represented in a single UTF-16 code unit. If the Unicode code point cannot be
represented in a single UTF-16 code unit (because its value is greater than
`0xFFFF`) then the code unit returned will be _the first part of a
surrogate pair_ for the code point. If you want the entire code point value, use
[`codePointAt()`](../../../globals/String/prototype/codePointAt.md).

## Syntax

```js
charCodeAt(index)
```

### Parameters

- `index`
  - : An integer greater than or equal to `0` and less than the
    `length` of the string. If `index` is not a number,
    it defaults to `0`.

### Return value

A number representing the UTF-16 code unit value of the character at the given
`index`. If `index` is out of range,
`charCodeAt()` returns `NaN`.

## Description

Unicode code points range from `0` to `1114111`
(`0x10FFFF`). The first 128 Unicode code points are a direct match of the
ASCII character encoding. (For information on Unicode, see [UTF-16 characters, Unicode codepoints, and grapheme clusters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_codepoints_and_grapheme_clusters).)

> **Note:** `charCodeAt()` will always return a value that is
> less than `65536`. This is because the higher code points are represented
> by _a pair_ of (lower valued) "surrogate" pseudo-characters which are used to
> comprise the real character.
>
> Because of this, in order to examine (or reproduce) the full character for individual
> character values of `65536` or greater, for such characters, it is
> necessary to retrieve not only `charCodeAt(i)`, but also
> `charCodeAt(i+1)` (as if manipulating a string with two
> letters), or to use `codePointAt(i)` instead. See examples 2 and
> 3 (below).

`charCodeAt()` returns `NaN` if the given
index is less than `0`, or if it is equal to or greater than the
`length` of the string.

Backward compatibility: In historic versions (like JavaScript 1.2) the
`charCodeAt()` method returns a number indicating the ISO-Latin-1 codeset
value of the character at the given index. The ISO-Latin-1 codeset ranges from
`0` to `255`. The first `0` to `127` are a
direct match of the ASCII character set.
