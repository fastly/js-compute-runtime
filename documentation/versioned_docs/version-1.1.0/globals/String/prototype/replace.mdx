# String.prototype.replace()

The **`replace()`** method returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a `pattern` replaced by a `replacement`. The `pattern` can be a string or a `RegExp`, and the `replacement` can be a string or a function called for each match. If `pattern` is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.

## Syntax

```js
replace(pattern, replacement)
```

### Parameters

- `pattern`
  - : Can be a string or an object with a [`Symbol.replace`](../../../globals/Symbol/replace.md) method — the typical example being a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp). Any value that doesn't have the `Symbol.replace` method will be coerced to a string.
- `replacement`
  - : Can be a string or a function.
    - If it's a string, it will replace the substring matched by `pattern`. A number of special replacement patterns are supported; see the [Specifying a string as the replacement](#specifying_a_string_as_the_replacement) section below.
    - If it's a function, it will be invoked for every match and its return value is used as the replacement text. The arguments supplied to this function are described in the [Specifying a function as the replacement](#specifying_a_function_as_the_replacement) section below.

### Return value

A new string, with one, some, or all matches of the pattern replaced by the specified replacement.

## Description

This method does not mutate the string value it's called on. It returns a new string.

A string pattern will only be replaced once. To perform a global search and replace, use a regular expression with the `g` flag, or use [`replaceAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll) instead.

If `pattern` is an object with a [`Symbol.replace`](../../../globals/Symbol/replace.md) method (including `RegExp` objects), that method is called with the target string and `replacement` as arguments. Its return value becomes the return value of `replace()`. In this case the behavior of `replace()` is entirely encoded by the `@@replace` method — for example, any mention of "capturing groups" in the description below is actually functionality provided by [`RegExp.prototype[@@replace]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/@@replace).

If the `pattern` is an empty string, the replacement is prepended to the start of the string.

```js
"xxx".replace("", "_"); // "_xxx"
```

A regexp with the `g` flag is the only case where `replace()` replaces more than once. For more information about how regex properties (especially the [sticky](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/sticky) flag) interact with `replace()`, see [`RegExp.prototype[@@replace]()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/@@replace).

### Specifying a string as the replacement

The replacement string can include the following special replacement patterns:

| Pattern   | Inserts                                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$$`      | Inserts a `"$"`.                                                                               |
| `$&`      | Inserts the matched substring.                                                                 |
| `` $` ``  | Inserts the portion of the string that precedes the matched substring.                         |
| `$'`      | Inserts the portion of the string that follows the matched substring.                          |
| `$n`      | Inserts the `n`th (`1`-indexed) capturing group where `n` is a positive integer less than 100. |
| `$<Name>` | Inserts the named capturing group where `Name` is the group name.                              |

`$n` and `$<Name>` are only available if the `pattern` argument is a `RegExp` object. If the `pattern` is a string, or if the corresponding capturing group isn't present in the regex, then the pattern will be replaced as a literal. If the group is present but isn't matched (because it's part of a disjunction), it will be replaced with an empty string.

```js
"foo".replace(/(f)/, "$2");
// "$2oo"; the regex doesn't have the second group

"foo".replace("f", "$1");
// "$1oo"; the pattern is a string, so it doesn't have any groups

"foo".replace(/(f)|(g)/, "$2");
// "oo"; the second group exists but isn't matched
```

### Specifying a function as the replacement

You can specify a function as the second parameter. In this case, the function will be invoked after the match has been performed. The function's result (return value) will be used as the replacement string.

> **Note:** The above-mentioned special replacement patterns do _not_ apply for strings returned from the replacer function.

The function has the following signature:

```js
function replacer(match, p1, p2, /* …, */ pN, offset, string, groups) {
  return replacement;
}
```

The arguments to the function are as follows:

- `match`
  - : The matched substring. (Corresponds to `$&` above.)
- `p1, p2, …, pN`
  - : The `n`th string found by a capture group (including named capturing groups), provided the first argument to `replace()` is a `RegExp` object. (Corresponds to `$1`, `$2`, etc. above.) For example, if the `pattern` is `/(\a+)(\b+)/`, then `p1` is the match for `\a+`, and `p2` is the match for `\b+`. If the group is part of a disjunction (e.g. `"abc".replace(/(a)|(b)/, replacer)`), the unmatched alternative will be `undefined`.
- `offset`
  - : The offset of the matched substring within the whole string being examined. For example, if the whole string was `'abcd'`, and the matched substring was `'bc'`, then this argument will be `1`.
- `string`
  - : The whole string being examined.
- `groups`
  - : An object whose keys are the used group names, and whose values are the matched portions (`undefined` if not matched). Only present if the `pattern` contains at least one named capturing group.

The exact number of arguments depends on whether the first argument is a `RegExp` object — and, if so, how many capture groups it has.

The following example will set `newString` to `'abc - 12345 - #$*%'`:

```js
function replacer(match, p1, p2, p3, offset, string) {
  // p1 is non-digits, p2 digits, and p3 non-alphanumerics
  return [p1, p2, p3].join(" - ");
}
const newString = "abc12345#$*%".replace(/([^\d]*)(\d*)([^\w]*)/, replacer);
console.log(newString); // abc - 12345 - #$*%
```

The function will be invoked multiple times for each full match to be replaced if the regular expression in the first parameter is global.
