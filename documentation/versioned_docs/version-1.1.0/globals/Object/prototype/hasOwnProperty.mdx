# Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()

The **`hasOwnProperty()`** method returns a boolean indicating whether the
object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting
it).

> **Note:** [`Object.hasOwn()`](../../../globals/Object/hasOwn.md) is recommended over
> `hasOwnProperty()`, in browsers where it is supported.

## Syntax

```js
hasOwnProperty(prop)
```

### Parameters

- `prop`
  - : The `String` name or `Symbol` of the property to test.

### Return value

Returns `true` if the object has the specified property as own property; `false`
otherwise.

## Description

The **`hasOwnProperty()`** method returns `true` if the specified property is a
direct property of the object — even if the value is `null` or `undefined`. The
method returns `false` if the property is inherited, or has not been declared at
all. Unlike the `in` operator, this
method does not check for the specified property in the object's prototype
chain.

The method can be called on _most_ JavaScript objects, because most objects
descend from `Object`, and hence inherit its methods. For
example `Array` is an `Object`, so you can
use `hasOwnProperty()` method to check whether an index exists:

```js
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana','Watermelon', 'Orange'];
fruits.hasOwnProperty(3);   // true ('Orange')
fruits.hasOwnProperty(4);   // false - not defined
```

The method will not be available in objects where it is reimplemented, or on
objects created using `Object.create(null)` (as these don't inherit from
`Object.prototype`). Examples for these cases are given below.
