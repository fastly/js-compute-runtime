# Object.preventExtensions()

The **`Object.preventExtensions()`** method prevents new
properties from ever being added to an object (i.e. prevents future extensions to the
object). It also prevents the object's prototype from being re-assigned.

## Syntax

```js
Object.preventExtensions(obj)
```

### Parameters

- `obj`
  - : The object which should be made non-extensible.

### Return value

The object being made non-extensible.

## Description

An object is extensible if new properties can be added to it.
`Object.preventExtensions()` marks an object as no longer extensible, so that
it will never have properties beyond the ones it had at the time it was marked as
non-extensible. Note that the properties of a non-extensible object, in general, may
still be _deleted_. Attempting to add new properties to a non-extensible object
will fail, either silently or, in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), throwing a [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.md).

Unlike [`Object.seal()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal) and [`Object.freeze()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze), `Object.preventExtensions()` invokes an intrinsic JavaScript behavior and cannot be replaced with a composition of several other operations. It also has its `Reflect` counterpart (which only exists for intrinsic operations), [`Reflect.preventExtensions()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/preventExtensions).

`Object.preventExtensions()` only prevents addition of own properties. Properties can still be added to the object prototype.

This method makes the `[[Prototype]]` of the target immutable; any `[[Prototype]]` re-assignment will throw a `TypeError`. This behavior is specific to the internal `[[Prototype]]` property; other properties of the target object will remain mutable.

There is no way to make an object extensible again once it has been made non-extensible.
