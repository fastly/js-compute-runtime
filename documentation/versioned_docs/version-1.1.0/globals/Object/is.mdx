# Object.is()

The **`Object.is()`** method determines whether two values are [the same value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#same-value_equality_using_object.is).

## Syntax

```js
Object.is(value1, value2)
```

### Parameters

- `value1`
  - : The first value to compare.
- `value2`
  - : The second value to compare.

### Return value

A boolean indicating whether or not the two arguments are the same value.

## Description

`Object.is()` determines whether two values are [the same value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#same-value_equality_using_object.is). Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

- both [`undefined`](../../globals/undefined.md)
- both `null`
- both `true` or both `false`
- both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
- both the same object (meaning both values reference the same object in memory)
- both `BigInts` with the same numeric value
- both `Symbols` that reference the same symbol value
- both numbers and

  - both `+0`
  - both `-0`
  - both [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.md)
  - or both non-zero, not [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.md), and have the same value

`Object.is()` is not equivalent to the [`==`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) operator. The `==` operator applies various coercions to both sides (if they are not the same type) before testing for equality (resulting in such behavior as `"" == false` being `true`), but `Object.is()` doesn't coerce either value.

`Object.is()` is also _not_ equivalent to the [`===`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) operator. The only difference between `Object.is()` and `===` is in their treatment of signed zeros and `NaN` values. The `===` operator (and the `==` operator) treats the number values `-0` and `+0` as equal, but treats [`NaN`](../../globals/NaN.md) as not equal to each other.
