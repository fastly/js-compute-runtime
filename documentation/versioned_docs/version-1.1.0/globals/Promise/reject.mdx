# Promise.reject()

The **`Promise.reject()`** method returns a `Promise` object that is rejected with a given reason.

## Syntax

```js
Promise.reject(reason)
```

### Parameters

- `reason`
  - : Reason why this `Promise` rejected.

### Return value

A `Promise` that is rejected with the given reason.

## Description

The static `Promise.reject` function returns a `Promise` that is rejected. For debugging purposes and selective error catching, it is useful to make `reason` an `instanceof` [`Error`](../../globals/Error/Error.md).

`Promise.reject()` is generic and supports subclassing, which means it can be called on subclasses of `Promise`, and the result will be a promise of the subclass type. To do so, the subclass's constructor must implement the same signature as the [`Promise()`](../../globals/Promise/Promise.md) constructor — accepting a single `executor` function that can be called with the `resolve` and `reject` callbacks as parameters. `Promise.reject()` is essentially a shorthand for `new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(reason))`.

Unlike [`Promise.resolve()`](../../globals/Promise/resolve.md), `Promise.reject()` always wraps `reason` in a new `Promise` object, even when `reason` is already a `Promise`.
