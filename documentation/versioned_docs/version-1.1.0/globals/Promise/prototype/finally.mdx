# Promise.prototype.finally()

The **`finally()`** method of a `Promise` object schedules a function to be called when the promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected). It immediately returns an equivalent `Promise` object, allowing you to [chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining) calls to other promise methods.

This lets you avoid duplicating code in both the promise's [`Promise.prototype.then`](../../../globals/Promise/prototype/then.md) and [`Promise.prototype.catch`](../../../globals/Promise/prototype/catch.md) handlers.

## Syntax

```js
finally(onFinally)

finally(() => {
  // Code that will run after promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected)
})
```

### Parameters

- `onFinally`
  - : A `Function` called when the `Promise` is settled. This handler receives no parameters.

### Return value

Returns an equivalent `Promise`. If the handler throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the promise returned by `finally()` will be rejected with that value instead. Otherwise, the return value of the handler does not affect the state of the original promise.

## Description

The `finally()` method can be useful if you want to do some processing or cleanup once the promise is settled, regardless of its outcome.

The `finally()` method is very similar to calling [`then(onFinally, onFinally)`](../../../globals/Promise/prototype/then.md). However, there are a couple of differences:

- When creating a function inline, you can pass it once, instead of being forced to either declare it twice, or create a variable for it.
- The `onFinally` callback does not receive any argument. This use case is for precisely when you _do not care_ about the rejection reason or the fulfillment value, and so there's no need to provide it.
- A `finally()` call is usually transparent and does not change the eventual state of the original promise. So for example:
  - Unlike `Promise.resolve(2).then(() => 77, () => {})`, which returns a promise eventually fulfilled with the value `77`, `Promise.resolve(2).finally(() => 77)` returns a promise eventually fulfilled with the value `2`.
  - Similarly, unlike `Promise.reject(3).then(() => {}, () => 88)`, which returns a promise eventually fulfilled with the value `88`, `Promise.reject(3).finally(() => 88)` returns a promise eventually rejected with the reason `3`.

> **Note:** A `throw` (or returning a rejected promise) in the `finally` callback still rejects the returned promise. For example, both `Promise.reject(3).finally(() => { throw 99; })` and `Promise.reject(3).finally(() => Promise.reject(99))` reject the returned promise with the reason `99`.

Like [`Promise.prototype.catch()`](../../../globals/Promise/prototype/catch.md), `finally()` internally calls the `then` method on the object upon which it was called. If `onFinally` is not a function, `then()` is called with `onFinally` as both arguments — which, for [`Promise.prototype.then()`](../../../globals/Promise/prototype/then.md), means that no useful handler is attached. Otherwise, `then()` is called with two internally created functions, which behave like the following:

> **Warning:** This is only for demonstration purposes and is not a polyfill.

```js
promise.then(
  (value) => Promise.resolve(onFinally()).then(() => value),
  (reason) =>
    Promise.resolve(onFinally()).then(() => {
      throw reason;
    }),
);
```

Because `finally()` calls `then()`, it supports subclassing. Moreover, notice the [`Promise.resolve()`](../../../globals/Promise/resolve.md) call above — in reality, `onFinally()`'s return value is resolved using the same algorithm as `Promise.resolve()`, but the actual constructor used to construct the resolved promise will be the subclass. `finally()` gets this constructor through [`promise.constructor[Symbol.species]`](../../../globals/Promise/@@species.md).
