# Symbol.toPrimitive

The **`Symbol.toPrimitive`** well-known symbol specifies a method that accepts a preferred type and returns a primitive representation of an object. It is called in priority by all [type coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#type_coercion) algorithms.

## Value

The well-known symbol `Symbol.toPrimitive`.

## Description

With the help of the `Symbol.toPrimitive` property (used as a function value), an object can be converted to a primitive value. The function is called with a string argument `hint`, which specifies the preferred type of the result primitive value. The `hint` argument can be one of `"number"`, `"string"`, and `"default"`.

The `"number"` hint is used by [numeric coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#numeric_coercion) algorithms. The `"string"` hint is used by the [string coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#string_coercion) algorithm. The `"default"` hint is used by the [primitive coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#primitive_coercion) algorithm. The `hint` only acts as a weak signal of preference, and the implementation is free to ignore it (as [`Symbol.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`](../../globals/Symbol/prototype/@@toPrimitive.md) does). The language does not enforce alignment between the `hint` and the result type, although `[Symbol.toPrimitive]()` must return a primitive, or a [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.md) is thrown.

Objects without the `Symbol.toPrimitive` property are converted to primitives by calling the `valueOf()` and `toString()` methods in different orders, which is explained in more detail in the [type coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#type_coercion) section. `Symbol.toPrimitive` allows full control over the primitive conversion process. For example, `Symbol.prototype.toString()` won't be called, and `Symbol` objects must always be explicitly converted to strings through [`String()`](../../globals/String/String.md].
