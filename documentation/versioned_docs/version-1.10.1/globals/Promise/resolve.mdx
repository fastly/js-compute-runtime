# Promise.resolve()

The **`Promise.resolve()`** method "resolves" a given value to a `Promise`. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a [thenable](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#thenables), `Promise.resolve()` will call the `then()` method with two callbacks it prepared; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.

This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that fulfills to a promise that fulfills to something) into a single layer — a promise that fulfills to a non-thenable value.

## Syntax

```js
Promise.resolve(value)
```

### Parameters

- `value`
  - : Argument to be resolved by this `Promise`. Can also be a `Promise` or a thenable to resolve.

### Return value

A `Promise` that is resolved with the given value, or the promise passed as value, if the value was a promise object. A resolved promise can be in any of the states — fulfilled, rejected, or pending. For example, resolving a rejected promise will still result in a rejected promise.

## Description

`Promise.resolve()` _resolves_ a promise, which is not the same as fulfilling or rejecting the promise. See [Promise description](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#description) for definitions of the terminology. In brief, `Promise.resolve()` returns a promise whose eventual state depends on another promise, thenable object, or other value.

`Promise.resolve()` is generic and supports subclassing, which means it can be called on subclasses of `Promise`, and the result will be a promise of the subclass type. To do so, the subclass's constructor must implement the same signature as the [`Promise()`](../../globals/Promise/Promise.mdx) constructor — accepting a single `executor` function that can be called with the `resolve` and `reject` callbacks as parameters.

`Promise.resolve()` special-cases native `Promise` instances. If `value` belongs to `Promise` or a subclass, and `value.constructor === Promise`, then `value` is directly returned by `Promise.resolve()`, without creating a new `Promise` instance. Otherwise, `Promise.resolve()` is essentially a shorthand for `new Promise((resolve) => resolve(value))`.

The bulk of the resolving logic is actually implemented by the [resolver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise#resolver_function) passed by the `Promise()` constructor. In summary:

- If a non-[thenable](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#thenables) value is passed, the returned promise is already fulfilled with that value.
- If a thenable is passed, the returned promise will adopt the state of that thenable by calling the `then` method and passing a pair of resolving functions as arguments. (But because native promises directly pass through `Promise.resolve()` without creating a wrapper, the `then` method is not called on native promises.) If the resolver function receives another thenable object, it will be resolved agin, so that the eventual fulfillment value of the promise will never be thenable.
