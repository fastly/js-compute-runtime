# Array.prototype.indexOf()

The **`indexOf()`** method returns the first index at which a
given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

## Syntax

```js
indexOf(searchElement)
indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)
```

### Parameters

- `searchElement`
  - : Element to locate in the array.
- `fromIndex` _**optional**_
  - : Zero-based index at which to start searching, converted to an integer.
    - Negative index counts back from the end of the array â€” if `fromIndex < 0`, `fromIndex + array.length` is used. Note, the array is still searched from front to back in this case.
    - If `fromIndex < -array.length` or `fromIndex` is omitted, `0` is used, causing the entire array to be searched.
    - If `fromIndex >= array.length`, the array is not searched and `-1` is returned.

### Return value

The first index of the element in the array; **-1** if not found.

## Description

The `indexOf()` method compares `searchElement` to elements of the array using [strict equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) (the same algorithm used by the `===` operator).

The `indexOf()` method skips empty slots in sparse arrays.

The `indexOf()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.
