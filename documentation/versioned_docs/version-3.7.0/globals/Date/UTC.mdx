# Date.UTC()

The **`Date.UTC()`** method accepts parameters similar to the
`Date` constructor, but treats them as UTC. It returns the number of
milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.



## Syntax

```js
Date.UTC(year)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute, second)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond)
```

- `year`

  - : Integer value representing the year.

    Values from `0` to `99` map to the years
    `1900` to `1999`. All other values are the actual year.
    See the [example](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#interpretation_of_two-digit_years).

- `monthIndex` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `0` (January) and `11` (December)
    representing the month. Since ECMAScript 2017 it defaults to `0` if
    omitted. _(Up until ECMAScript 2016, `monthIndex` was a required
    parameter. As of ES2017, it no longer is.)_
- `day` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `1` and `31` representing the day of the
    month. If omitted, defaults to `1`.
- `hour` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `0` and `23` representing the hours. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `minute` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `0` and `59` representing the minutes. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `second` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `0` and `59` representing the seconds. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `millisecond` _**optional**_
  - : An integer between `0` and `999` representing the
    milliseconds. If omitted, defaults to `0`.

### Return value

A number representing the number of milliseconds for the given date since January 1,
1970, 00:00:00, UTC.

## Description

`UTC()` takes comma-delimited date and time parameters and returns the
number of milliseconds between January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, universal time and the
specified date and time.

Years between `0` and `99` are converted to a year in the
20th century `(1900 + year)`. For example, `95` is
converted to the year `1995`.

The `UTC()` method differs from the `Date` constructor in two
ways:

1. `Date.UTC()` uses universal time instead of the local time.
2. `Date.UTC()` returns a time value as a number instead of creating a
   `Date` object.

If a parameter is outside of the expected range, the `UTC()` method updates
the other parameters to accommodate the value. For example, if `15` is used
for `monthIndex`, the year will be incremented by 1
`(year + 1)` and `3` will be used for the month.

`UTC()` is a static method of `Date`, so it's called as
`Date.UTC()` rather than as a method of a `Date` instance.
