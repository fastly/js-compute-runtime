# Array.isArray()

The **`Array.isArray()`** static method determines whether the passed value is an `Array`.

## Syntax

```js
Array.isArray(value)
```

### Parameters

- `value`
  - : The value to be checked.

### Return value

`true` if `value` is an `Array`; otherwise, `false`. `false` is always returned if `value` is a `TypedArray` instance.

## Description

`Array.isArray()` checks if the passed value is an `Array`. It does not check the value's prototype chain, nor does it rely on the `Array` constructor it is attached to. It returns `true` for any value that was created using the array literal syntax or the `Array` constructor. This makes it safe to use with cross-realm objects, where the identity of the `Array` constructor is different and would therefore cause `instanceof Array` to fail.

See the article ["Determining with absolute accuracy whether or not a JavaScript object is an array"](https://web.mit.edu/jwalden/www/isArray.html) for more details.

`Array.isArray()` also rejects objects with `Array.prototype` in its prototype chain but aren't actual arrays, which `instanceof Array` would accept.
