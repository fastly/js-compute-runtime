# Getting started

First, make sure to have [Fastly's CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/tools/cli/) installed:

The Fastly CLI is available for multiple operating systems.

- **MacOS**: Install from Homebrew:

    ```
    brew install fastly/tap/fastly
    ```

- **Windows**: [Visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fastly/cli/releases/latest) to download the prebuilt binary for your architecture.
- **Linux**: Packages are available for many distributions, along with prebuilt binaries. [Visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fastly/cli/releases/latest) to download the package for your distribution.

## Initialise a new project

Create a new Fastly Compute@Edge JavaScript project:

```shell
fastly compute init --language javascript --from https://github.com/fastly/compute-starter-kit-javascript-empty
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Try it out locally


```shell
fastly compute serve --watch
```

Your application should now be running on [http://localhost:7676](http://localhost:7676)
