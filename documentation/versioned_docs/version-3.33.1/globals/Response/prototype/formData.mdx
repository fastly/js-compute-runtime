The **`formData()`** method of the [`Response`](../../../globals/Response/Response.mdx) interface takes a [`Response`](../../../globals/Response/Response.mdx) stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise that resolves with a `FormData` object.

## Syntax

```js
formData()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves with a [`FormData`](../../../globals/FormData/FormData.mdx) object.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the response body has already been consumed.
- `SyntaxError`
  - : Thrown if the response's content type is not `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or if the content cannot be parsed as form data.
