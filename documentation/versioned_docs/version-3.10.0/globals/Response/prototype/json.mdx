# Response.json()

The **`json()`** method of the [`Response`](../../../globals/Response/Response.mdx) interface takes
a [`Response`](../../../globals/Response/Response.mdx) stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which
resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.

Note that despite the method being named `json()`, the result is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object.

## Syntax

```js
json()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](../../../globals/Promise/Promise.mdx) that resolves to a JavaScript object. This object could be
anything that can be represented by JSON — an object, an array, a string, a number…
