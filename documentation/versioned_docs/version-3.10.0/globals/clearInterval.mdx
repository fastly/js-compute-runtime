# clearInterval()

The global **`clearInterval()`** method cancels a timed, repeating action which
was previously established by a call to `setInterval()`.
If the parameter provided does not identify a previously established action,
this method does nothing.

## Syntax

```js
clearInterval(intervalID)
```

### Parameters

- `intervalID`
  - : The identifier of the repeated action you want to cancel. This ID was returned by
    the corresponding call to `setInterval()`.

It's worth noting that the pool of IDs used by
`setInterval()` and
`setTimeout()` are shared, which
means you can technically use `clearInterval()` and
`clearTimeout()` interchangeably.
However, for clarity, you should avoid doing so.

### Return value

None `undefined`.
