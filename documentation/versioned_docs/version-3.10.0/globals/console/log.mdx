# console.log()

The **`console.log()`** method outputs a message to the console.

## Syntax

```js
log(obj1)
log(obj1, /* …, */ objN)
```

### Parameters

- `obj1` … `objN`
  - : A list of JavaScript objects to output. The string representations of each of these
    objects are appended together in the order listed and output. Please be warned that if
    you log objects in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox what you get logged on
    the console is a _reference to the object_, which is not necessarily the
    'value' of the object at the moment in time you call `console.log()`, but
    it is the value of the object at the moment you open the console.

### Return value

None `undefined`.
