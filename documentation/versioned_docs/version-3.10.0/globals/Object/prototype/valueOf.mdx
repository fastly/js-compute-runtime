# Object.prototype.valueOf()

The **`valueOf()`** method of `Object` converts the `this` value [to an object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#object_coercion). This method is meant to be overridden by derived objects for custom [type conversion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#type_coercion) logic.



## Syntax

```js
valueOf()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

The `this` value, converted to an object.

> **Note:** In order for `valueOf` to be useful during type conversion, it must return a primitive. Because all primitive types have their own `valueOf()` methods, calling `aPrimitiveValue.valueOf()` generally does not invoke `Object.prototype.valueOf()`.

## Description

JavaScript calls the `valueOf` method to [convert an object to a primitive value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#type_coercion). You rarely need to invoke the `valueOf` method yourself; JavaScript automatically invokes it when encountering an object where a primitive value is expected.

This method is called in priority by [numeric conversion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#numeric_coercion) and [primitive conversion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#primitive_coercion), but [string conversion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#string_coercion) calls `toString()` in priority, and `toString()` is very likely to return a string value (even for the [`Object.prototype.toString()`](../../../globals/Object/prototype/toString.mdx) base implementation), so `valueOf()` is usually not called in this case.

All objects that inherit from `Object.prototype` (that is, all except [`null`-prototype objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects)) inherit the `toString()` method. The `Object.prototype.valueOf()` base implementation is deliberately useless: by returning an object, its return value will never be used by any [primitive conversion algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#type_coercion). Many built-in objects override this method to return an appropriate primitive value. When you create a custom object, you can override `valueOf()` to call a custom method, so that your custom object can be converted to a primitive value. Generally, `valueOf()` is used to return a value that is most meaningful for the object â€” unlike `toString()`, it does not need to be a string. Alternatively, you can add a [`Symbol.toPrimitive`](../../../globals/Symbol/toPrimitive.mdx) method, which allows even more control over the conversion process, and will always be preferred over `valueOf` or `toString` for any type conversion.
