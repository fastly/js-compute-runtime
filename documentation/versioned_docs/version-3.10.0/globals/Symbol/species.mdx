# Symbol.species

The well-known symbol **`Symbol.species`** specifies a function-valued property that the constructor function uses to create derived objects.

> **Warning:** The existence of `Symbol.species` allows execution of arbitrary code and may create security vulnerabilities. It also makes certain optimizations much harder. Engine implementers are [investigating whether to remove this feature](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-rm-builtin-subclassing). Avoid relying on it if possible.

## Value

The well-known symbol `Symbol.species`.

## Description

The `Symbol.species` accessor property allows subclasses to override the default constructor for objects. This specifies a protocol about how instances should be copied. For example, when you use copying methods of arrays, such as [`Array.prototype.map()`](../../globals/Array/prototype/map.mdx). the `map()` method uses `instance.constructor[Symbol.species]` to get the constructor for constructing the new array.

All built-in implementations of `Symbol.species` return the `this` value, which is the current instance's constructor. This allows copying methods to create instances of derived classes rather than the base class â€” for example, `map()` will return an array of the same type as the original array.
