# fetch()

The global **`fetch()`** method starts the process of fetching a
resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is
available.

The promise resolves to the `Response` object
representing the response to your request.

A `fetch()` promise only rejects when a
network error is encountered (which is usually when there's a permissions issue or
similar). A `fetch()` promise _does
not_ reject on HTTP errors (`404`, etc.). Instead, a
`then()` handler must check the `Response.ok` and/or
`Response.status` properties.

> **Note:** The `fetch()` method's parameters are identical to
> those of the `Request()` constructor.

## Syntax

```js
fetch(resource)
fetch(resource, options)
```

### Parameters

- `resource`

  - : This defines the resource that you wish to fetch. This can either be:

    - A string or any other object with a "toString" method.
    - A `Request` object.

- `options` _**optional**_

  - : An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request. The
    possible options are:

    - `method`
      - : The request method, e.g., `GET`, `POST`.
    - `headers`
      - : Any headers you want to add to your request, contained within a
        `Headers` object or an object literal with `String`
        values.
    - `body`
      - : Any body that you want to add to your request: this can be an `ArrayBuffer`, a `TypedArray`, a `DataView`, a `URLSearchParams`, string object or literal, or a `ReadableStream` object.
    - `backend` _**Fastly-specific**_
      - *Fastly-specific*
    - `cacheOverride` _**Fastly-specific**_
    - `cacheKey` _**Fastly-specific**_
    - `fastly` _**Fastly-specific**_
      - `decompressGzip`_: boolean_ _**optional**_
        - Whether to automatically gzip decompress the Response or not.

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object.
