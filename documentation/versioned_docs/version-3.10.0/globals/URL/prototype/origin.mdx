# URL.origin

The **`origin`** read-only property of
the `URL` interface returns a string containing the
Unicode serialization of the origin of the represented URL.

The exact structure
varies depending on the type of URL:

- For `http` or `https` URLs, the scheme followed by
  `'://'`, followed by the domain, followed by `':'`, followed by
  the port (the default port, `80` and `443` respectively, if
  explicitly specified).
- For `file:` URLs, the value is browser dependent.
- for `blob:` URLs, the origin of the URL following `blob:` will
  be used. For example, `"blob:https://mozilla.org"` will be returned as
  `"https://mozilla.org".`

A string.
