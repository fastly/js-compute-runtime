# clearTimeout()

The global **`clearTimeout()`** method cancels a timeout previously established
by calling `setTimeout()`.

If the parameter provided does not identify a previously established action,
this method does nothing.

## Syntax

```js
clearTimeout(timeoutID)
```

### Parameters

- `timeoutID`
  - : The identifier of the timeout you want to cancel. This ID was returned by the
    corresponding call to `setTimeout()`.

It's worth noting that the pool of IDs used by
`setTimeout()` and
`setInterval()` are shared, which
means you can technically use `clearTimeout()` and
`clearInterval()`
interchangeably. However, for clarity, you should avoid doing so.

### Return value

None `undefined`.
