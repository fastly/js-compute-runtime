# String.fromCharCode()

The static **`String.fromCharCode()`** method returns a string
created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units.

## Syntax

```js
String.fromCharCode(num1)
String.fromCharCode(num1, num2)
String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, /* â€¦, */ numN)
```

### Parameters

- `num1, ..., numN`
  - : A sequence of numbers that are UTF-16 code units. The range is between
    `0` and `65535` (`0xFFFF`). Numbers greater than
    `0xFFFF` are truncated. No validity checks are performed.

### Return value

A string of length `N` consisting of the
`N` specified UTF-16 code units.

## Description

This method returns a string and not a `String` object.

Because `fromCharCode()` is a static method of `String`, you
always use it as `String.fromCharCode()`, rather than as a method of a
`String` object you created.
