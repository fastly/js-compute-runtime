# Number.EPSILON

The **`Number.EPSILON`** property represents the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point number greater than 1.

## Value

2<sup>-52</sup>, or approximately `2.2204460492503130808472633361816E-16`.

## Description

`Number.EPSILON` is the difference between 1 and the next greater number representable in the Number format, because [double precision floating point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format) only has 52 bits to represent the [mantissa](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#number_encoding), and the lowest bit has a significance of 2<sup>-52</sup>.

Note that the absolute accuracy of floating numbers decreases as the number gets larger, because the exponent grows while the mantissa's accuracy stays the same. `Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest representable positive number, which is much smaller than `Number.EPSILON`.

Because `EPSILON` is a static property of `Number`, you always use it as `Number.EPSILON`, rather than as a property of a number value.
