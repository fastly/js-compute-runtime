# Number.MIN_VALUE

The **`Number.MIN_VALUE`** property represents the smallest positive numeric value representable in JavaScript.

## Value

2<sup>-1074</sup>, or `5E-324`.

## Description

`Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest positive number (not the most negative number) that can be represented within float precision — in other words, the number closest to 0. The ECMAScript spec doesn't define a precise value that implementations are required to support — instead the spec says, _"must be the smallest non-zero positive value that can actually be represented by the implementation"_. This is because small IEEE-754 floating point numbers are [denormalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_number), but implementations are not required to support this representation, in which case `Number.MIN_VALUE` may be larger.

In practice, its precise value in mainstream engines like V8 (used by Chrome, Edge, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari) is 2<sup>-1074</sup>, or `5E-324`.

Because `MIN_VALUE` is a static property of `Number`, you always use it as `Number.MIN_VALUE`, rather than as a property of a number value.
