# Request.body

The read-only **`body`** property of the `Request`
interface contains a `ReadableStream` with the body contents
that have been added to the request. Note that a request using the
`GET` or `HEAD` method cannot have a body
and `null` is returned in these cases.

## Value

A `ReadableStream` or `null`.
