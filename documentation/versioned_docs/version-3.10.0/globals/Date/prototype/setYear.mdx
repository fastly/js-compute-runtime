# Date.prototype.setYear()

The legacy **`setYear()`** method sets the year for a specified date according to local time.

However, the way the legacy `setYear()` method sets year values is different from how the preferred [`Date.prototype.setFullYear()`](./setFullYear.mdx) method sets year values â€” and in some cases, also different from how `new Date()` and [`Date.parse()`](../parse.mdx) set year values. Specifically, given two-digit numbers, such as `22` and `61`:

- `setYear()` interprets any two-digit number as an offset to `1900`; so `date.setYear(22)` results in the year value being set to `1922`, and `date.setYear(61)` results in the year value being set to `1961`. (In contrast, while `new Date(61, 1)` also results in the year value being set to `1961`, `new Date("2/1/22")` results in the year value being set to `2022`; and similarly for [`Date.parse()`](../parse.mdx)).

- [`Date.prototype.setFullYear()`](./setFullYear.mdx) does no special interpretation but instead uses the literal two-digit value as-is to set the year; so `date.setFullYear(61)` results in the year value being set to `0061`, and `date.setFullYear(22)` results in the year value being set to `0022`.

Because of those differences in behavior, you should no longer use the legacy `setYear()` method, but should instead use the preferred [`Date.prototype.setFullYear()`](./setFullYear.mdx) method.

## Syntax

```js
setYear(yearValue)
```

### Parameters

- `yearValue`
  - : An integer.

### Return value

The number of milliseconds between 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the updated date.

## Description

If `yearValue` is a number between 0 and 99 (inclusive), then the year for
`dateObj` is set to `1900 + yearValue`. Otherwise, the year for
`dateObj` is set to `yearValue`.
