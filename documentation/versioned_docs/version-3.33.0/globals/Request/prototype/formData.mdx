formData()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves with a [`FormData`](../../../globals/FormData/FormData.mdx) object.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the request body has already been used or if the request's method is `GET` or `HEAD`.
- `SyntaxError`
  - : Thrown if the request's content type is not `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, or if the content cannot be parsed as form data.
