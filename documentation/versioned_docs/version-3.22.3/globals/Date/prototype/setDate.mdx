# Date.prototype.setDate()

The **`setDate()`** method changes the day of the month of a given `Date` instance, based on local time.

To instead change the day of the month for a given `Date` instance based on UTC time, use the [`Date.prototype.setUTCDate()`](./setUTCDate.mdx) method.

## Syntax

```js
setDate(dayValue)
```

### Parameters

- `dayValue`
  - : An integer representing the day of the month.

### Return value

The number of milliseconds between 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the given date (the
`Date` object is also changed in place).

## Description

If the `dayValue` is outside of the range of date values for the month, `setDate()` will update the `Date` object accordingly.

For example, if 0 is provided for `dayValue`, the date will be set to the last day of the previous month. If you use 40 for `dayValue`, and the month stored in the `Date` object is June, the day will be changed to 10 and the month will be incremented to July.

If a negative number is provided for `dayValue`, the date will be set counting backwards from the last day of the previous month. -1 would result in the date being set to 1 day before the last day of the previous month.
