# Math.atan2()

The **`Math.atan2()`** function returns the angle in the plane (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the ray from (0, 0) to the point (x, y), for `Math.atan2(y, x)`.

## Syntax

```js
Math.atan2(y, x)
```

### Parameters

- `y`
  - : The y coordinate of the point.
- `x`
  - : The x coordinate of the point.

### Return value

The angle in radians (between -π and π, inclusive) between the positive x-axis and the ray from (0, 0) to the point (x, y).

## Description

The `Math.atan2()` method measures the counterclockwise angle θ, in radians, between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. Note that the arguments to this function pass the y-coordinate first and the x-coordinate second.

`Math.atan2()` is passed separate `x` and `y` arguments, while [`Math.atan()`](./atan.mdx) is passed the ratio of those two arguments. `Math.atan2(y, x)` differs from `Math.atan(y / x)` in the following cases:

| `x`                  | `y`         | `Math.atan2(y, x)` | `Math.atan(y / x)` |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `Infinity`           | `Infinity`  | π / 4              | `NaN`              |
| `Infinity`           | `-Infinity` | -π / 4             | `NaN`              |
| `-Infinity`          | `Infinity`  | 3π / 4             | `NaN`              |
| `-Infinity`          | `-Infinity` | -3π / 4            | `NaN`              |
| 0                    | 0           | 0                  | `NaN`              |
| 0                    | -0          | -0                 | `NaN`              |
| < 0 (including `-0`) | 0           | π                  | 0                  |
| < 0 (including `-0`) | -0          | -π                 | 0                  |
| `-Infinity`          | > 0         | π                  | -0                 |
| -0                   | > 0         | π / 2              | -π / 2             |
| `-Infinity`          | < 0         | -π                 | 0                  |
| -0                   | < 0         | -π / 2             | π / 2              |

In addition, for points in the second and third quadrants (`x < 0`), `Math.atan2()` would output an angle less than <math><semantics><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mi>π</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></semantics></math>.

Because `atan2()` is a static method of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.atan2()`, rather than as a method of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
