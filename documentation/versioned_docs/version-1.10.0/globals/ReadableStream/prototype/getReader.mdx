# ReadableStream.getReader()

The **`getReader()`** method of the `ReadableStream` interface creates a reader and locks the stream to it.
While the stream is locked, no other reader can be acquired until this one is released.

## Syntax

```js
getReader()
getReader(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options` _**optional**_

  - : An object containing the following properties:

    - `mode` _**optional**_

      - : A property that specifies the type of reader to create.
        Values can be:

        - `"byob"`, which results in a `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` being created that can read readable byte streams (streams that support zero-copy transfer from an underlying byte source to the reader when internal stream buffers are empty).
        - `undefined` (or not specified at all â€” this is the default), which results in a `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` being created that can read individual chunks from a stream.

### Return value

A `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` or `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` object instance, depending on the `mode` value.

### Exceptions

- `RangeError`
  - : Thrown if the provided mode value is not `"byob"` or `undefined`.
- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the stream you are trying to create a reader for is already locked, or not a `ReadableStream`.
