# WritableStreamDefaultController.error()

The **`error()`** method of the
`WritableStreamDefaultController` interface causes any future interactions
with the associated stream to error.

This method is rarely used, since usually it suffices to return a rejected promise from
one of the underlying sink's methods. However, it can be useful for suddenly shutting
down a stream in response to an event outside the normal lifecycle of interactions with
the underlying sink.

## Syntax

```js
error(message)
```

### Parameters

- `message`
  - : A string representing the error you want future interactions to
    fail with.

### Return value

None `undefined`.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : The stream you are trying to error is not a `WritableStream`.
