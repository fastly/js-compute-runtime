# enqueue()

The **`enqueue()`** method of the `ReadableByteStreamController` interface enqueues a given chunk on the associated readable byte stream (the chunk is copied into the stream's internal queues).

This should only be used to transfer data to the queue when `byobRequest` is `null`.

## Syntax

```js
enqueue(chunk)
```

### Parameters

- `chunk`
  - : The chunk to enqueue.

### Return value

`undefined`.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if the source object is not a `ReadableByteStreamController`, or the stream cannot be read for some other reason, or the chunk is not an object, or the chunk's internal array buffer is non-existent, zero-length, or detached.
    It is also thrown if the stream has been closed.
