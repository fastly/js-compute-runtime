# verify()

The **`verify()`** method verifies a digital signature.

It takes as its arguments a key to verify the signature with, some algorithm-specific parameters, the signature, and the original signed data.
It returns a `Promise` which will be fulfilled with a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid.

## Syntax

```js
verify(algorithm, key, signature, data)
```

### Parameters

- `algorithm`
  - : A string or object defining the algorithm to use, and for some algorithm choices, some extra parameters.
    The values given for the extra parameters must match those passed into the corresponding [`sign()`](./sign.mdx) call.
    - To use RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, pass the string `"RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5"` or an object of the form `{ "name": "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5" }`.
- `key`
  - : A [`CryptoKey`](../../CryptoKey/CryptoKey.mdx) containing the key that will be used to verify the signature.
    It is the secret key for a symmetric algorithm and the public key for a public-key system.
- `signature`
  - : A `ArrayBuffer` containing the signature to verify.
- `data`
  - : A `ArrayBuffer` containing the data whose signature is to be verified.

### Return value

A `Promise` that fulfills with a
boolean value: `true` if the signature is valid, `false`
otherwise.

### Exceptions

The promise is rejected when the following exception is encountered:

- `InvalidAccessError`
  - : Raised when the encryption key is not a key for the requested verifying algorithm or
    when trying to use an algorithm that is either unknown or isn't suitable for a verify
    operation.

## Supported algorithms

The `verify()` method supports the same algorithms as the [`sign()`](./sign.mdx) method.
