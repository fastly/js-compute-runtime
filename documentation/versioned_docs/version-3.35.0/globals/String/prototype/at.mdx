# String.prototype.at()

The **`at()`** method takes an integer value and returns a `('String` consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset. This method allows for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count back from the last string character.

## Syntax

```js
at(index)
```

### Parameters

- `index`
  - : The index (position) of the string character to be returned. Supports relative indexing from the end of the string when passed a negative index; i.e. if a negative number is used, the character returned will be found by counting back from the end of the string.

### Return value

`('String` consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified position. Returns [`undefined`](../../../globals/undefined.mdx) if the given index can not be found.
