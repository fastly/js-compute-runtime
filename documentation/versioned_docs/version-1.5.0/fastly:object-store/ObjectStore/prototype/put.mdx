# ObjectStore.prototype.put

The **`put()`** method stores a `value` into the Object store under a `key`.

> **Note**: Object stores are eventually consistent, this means that the updated contents associated with the key `key` may not be available to read from all edge locations immediately and some edge locations may continue returning the previous contents associated with the key.

## Syntax

```js
put(key, value)
```

### Parameters

- `key` _: string_
  - The key to store the supplied value under within the Object store.
- `value` _:  ArrayBuffer | TypedArray | DataView| ReadableStream | URLSearchParams | String | string literal_
  - The value to store within the Object store.

### Return value

Returns a `Promise` which resolves with `undefined` when the provided `value` has been written into the Object store.

## Description

Stores the supplied `value` into the Object store under the supplied `key`.

The `put()` method requires its `this` value to be a [`ObjectStore`](../ObjectStore.mdx) object.

If the `this` value does not inherit from `ObjectStore.prototype`, a [`TypeError`](../../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.mdx) is thrown.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - If the provided `key`:
    - Is any of the strings `""`, `"."`, or `".."`
    - Starts with the string `".well-known/acme-challenge/"`
    - Contains any of the characters `"#?*[]\n\r"`
    - Is longer than 1024 characters

## Examples

In this example we connect to an Object Store named `'files'` and save an entry to the store under the key `'hello'` and then read back the value and return it to the client.

```js
/// <reference types="@fastly/js-compute" />

import { ObjectStore } from "fastly:object-store";

async function app(event) {
  const files = new ObjectStore('files')

  await files.put('hello', 'world')

  const entry = await files.put('hello')

  return new Response(await entry.text())
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(app(event)))

```
