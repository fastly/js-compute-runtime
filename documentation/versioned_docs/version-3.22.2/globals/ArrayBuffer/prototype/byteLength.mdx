# ArrayBuffer.prototype.byteLength

The **`byteLength`** accessor property represents the length of an `ArrayBuffer` in bytes.

## Description

The `byteLength` property is an accessor property whose set accessor function is `undefined`, meaning that you can only read this property. The value is established when the array is constructed and cannot be changed. This property returns 0 if this `ArrayBuffer` has been detached.
