# DataView.prototype.buffer

The **`buffer`** accessor property represents the `ArrayBuffer` referenced by the `DataView` at construction time.

## Description

The `buffer` property is an accessor property whose set accessor function is `undefined`, meaning that you can only read this property. The value is established when the `DataView` is constructed and cannot be changed.
