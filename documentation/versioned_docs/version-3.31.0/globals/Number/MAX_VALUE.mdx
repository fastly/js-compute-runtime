# Number.MAX_VALUE

The **`Number.MAX_VALUE`** property represents the maximum numeric value representable in JavaScript.

## Value

2<sup>1024</sup> - 1, or approximately `1.7976931348623157E+308`.

## Description

Values larger than `MAX_VALUE` are represented as [`Infinity`](../../globals/Infinity.mdx) and will lose their actual value.

Because `MAX_VALUE` is a static property of `Number`, you always use it as `Number.MAX_VALUE`, rather than as a property of a number value.
