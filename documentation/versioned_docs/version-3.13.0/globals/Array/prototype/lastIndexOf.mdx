# Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()

The **`lastIndexOf()`** method returns the last index at which
a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. The array is
searched backwards, starting at `fromIndex`.

## Syntax

```js
lastIndexOf(searchElement)
lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)
```

### Parameters

- `searchElement`
  - : Element to locate in the array.
- `fromIndex` _**optional**_
  - : Zero-based index at which to start searching backwards, converted to an integer.
    - Negative index counts back from the end of the array â€” if `fromIndex < 0`, `fromIndex + array.length` is used.
    - If `fromIndex < -array.length`, the array is not searched and `-1` is returned. You can think of it conceptually as starting at a nonexistent position before the beginning of the array and going backwards from there. There are no array elements on the way, so `searchElement` is never found.
    - If `fromIndex >= array.length` or `fromIndex` is omitted, `array.length - 1` is used, causing the entire array to be searched. You can think of it conceptually as starting at a nonexistent position beyond the end of the array and going backwards from there. It eventually reaches the real end position of the array, at which point it starts searching backwards through the actual array elements.

### Return value

The last index of the element in the array; **-1** if not found.

## Description

The `lastIndexOf()` method compares `searchElement` to elements of the array using [strict equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) (the same algorithm used by the `===` operator).

The `lastIndexOf()` method skips empty slots in sparse arrays.

The `lastIndexOf()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.
