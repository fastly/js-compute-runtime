# Array.prototype.includes()

The **`includes()`** method determines whether an array
includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or
`false` as appropriate.

## Syntax

```js
includes(searchElement)
includes(searchElement, fromIndex)
```

### Parameters

- `searchElement`
  - : The value to search for.
- `fromIndex` _**optional**_
  - : Zero-based index at which to start searching, converted to an integer.
    - Negative index counts back from the end of the array â€” if `fromIndex < 0`, `fromIndex + array.length` is used. However, the array is still searched from front to back in this case.
    - If `fromIndex < -array.length` or `fromIndex` is omitted, `0` is used, causing the entire array to be searched.
    - If `fromIndex >= array.length`, the array is not searched and `false` is returned.

### Return value

A boolean value which is `true` if the value `searchElement` is found within the array (or the part of the array indicated by the index `fromIndex`, if specified).

## Description

The `includes()` method compares `searchElement` to elements of the array using the [SameValueZero](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) algorithm. Values of zero are all considered to be equal, regardless of sign. (That is, `-0` is equal to `0`), but `false` is _not_ considered to be the same as `0`. [`NaN`](../../NaN.mdx) can be correctly searched for.

When used on sparse arrays, the `includes()` method iterates empty slots as if they have the value `undefined`.

The `includes()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.
