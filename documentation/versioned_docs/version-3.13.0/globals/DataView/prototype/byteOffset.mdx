# DataView.prototype.byteOffset

The **`byteOffset`** accessor property represents the offset (in bytes) of this view from the start of its `ArrayBuffer`.

## Description

The `byteOffset` property is an accessor property whose set accessor function is `undefined`, meaning that you can only read this property. The value is established when an `DataView` is constructed and cannot be changed.
