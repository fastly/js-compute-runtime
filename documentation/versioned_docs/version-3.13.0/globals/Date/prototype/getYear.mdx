# Date.prototype.getYear()

The **`getYear()`** method returns the year in the specified
date according to local time. Because `getYear()` does not return full years
("year 2000 problem"), it is no longer used and has been replaced by the
[`Date.prototype.getFullYear()`](./getFullYear.mdx) method.

## Syntax

```js
getYear()
```

### Return value

A number representing the year of the given date, according to local time, minus 1900.

## Description

- For years greater than or equal to 2000, the value returned by
  `getYear()` is 100 or greater. For example, if the year is 2026,
  `getYear()` returns 126.
- For years between and including 1900 and 1999, the value returned by
  `getYear()` is between 0 and 99. For example, if the year is 1976,
  `getYear()` returns 76.
- For years less than 1900, the value returned by `getYear()` is less than 0. For example, if the year is 1800, `getYear()` returns -100.

To take into account years before and after 2000, you should use
[`Date.prototype.getFullYear()`](./getFullYear.mdx) instead of
`getYear()` so that the year is specified in full.
