# Math.PI

The **`Math.PI`** property represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, approximately 3.14159.

## Value

`3.141592653589793`

## Description

Because `PI` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.PI`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
