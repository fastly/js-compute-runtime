# Proxy.revocable()

The **`Proxy.revocable()`** static method creates a revocable `Proxy` object.

## Syntax

```js
Proxy.revocable(target, handler)
```

### Parameters

- `target`
  - : A target object to wrap with `Proxy`. It can be any sort of object, including a native array, a function, or even another proxy.
- `handler`
  - : An object whose properties are functions defining the behavior of `proxy` when an operation is performed on it.

### Return value

A plain object with the following two properties:

- `proxy`
  - : A Proxy object exactly the same as one created with a [handler)`](../../globals/Proxy/Proxy.mdx `new Proxy(target,) call.
- `revoke`
  - : A function with no parameters to revoke (switch off) the `proxy`.

## Description

The `Proxy.revocable()` factory function is the same as the [`Proxy()`](../../globals/Proxy/Proxy.mdx) constructor, except that in addition to creating a proxy object, it also creates a `revoke` function that can be called to disable the proxy. The proxy object and the `revoke` function are wrapped in a plain object.

The `revoke` function does not take any parameters, nor does it rely on the `this` value. The created `proxy` object is attached to the `revoke` function as a [private property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields) that the `revoke` function accesses on itself when called (the existence of the private property is not observable from the outside, but it has implications on how garbage collection happens). The `proxy` object is _not_ captured within the [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) of the `revoke` function (which will make garbage collection of `proxy` impossible if `revoke` is still alive).

After the `revoke()` function gets called, the proxy becomes unusable: any trap to a handler throws a [`TypeError`](../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.mdx). Once a proxy is revoked, it remains revoked, and calling `revoke()` again has no effect — in fact, the call to `revoke()` detaches the `proxy` object from the `revoke` function, so the `revoke` function will not be able to access the proxy again at all. If the proxy is not referenced elsewhere, it will then be eligible for garbage collection. The `revoke` function also detaches `target` and `handler` from the `proxy`, so if `target` is not referenced elsewhere, it will also be eligible for garbage collection, even when its proxy is still alive, since there's no longer a way to meaningfully interact with the target object.

Letting users interact with an object through a revocable proxy allows you to [control the lifetime](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management) of the object exposed to the user — you can make the object garbage-collectable even when the user is still holding a reference to its proxy.
