# Function.prototype.name

The **`name`** property of a `Function` instance indicates the function's name as specified when it was created, or it may be either `anonymous` or `''` (an empty string) for functions created anonymously.

## Value

A string.

> **Note:** In non-standard, pre-ES2015 implementations the `configurable` attribute was `false` as well.

## Description

The function's `name` property can be used to identify the function in debugging tools or error messages. It has no semantic significance to the language itself.

The `name` property is read-only and cannot be changed by the assignment operator:

```js
function someFunction() {}

someFunction.name = 'otherFunction';
console.log(someFunction.name); // someFunction
```

To change it, use [`Object.defineProperty()`](../../../globals/Object/defineProperty.mdx).

The `name` property is typically inferred from how the function is defined. In the following sections, we will describe the various ways in which it can be inferred.

### Function declaration

The `name` property returns the name of a function declaration.

```js
function doSomething() {}
doSomething.name; // "doSomething"
```

### Default-exported function declaration

An [`export default`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) declaration exports the function as a declaration instead of an expression. If the declaration is anonymous, the name is `"default"`.

```js
// -- someModule.js --
export default function () {};

// -- main.js --
import someModule from "./someModule.js";

someModule.name; // "default"
```

### Function constructor

Functions created with the [`Function()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) constructor have name "anonymous".

```js
new Function().name; // "anonymous"
```

### Function expression

If the function expression is named, that name is used as the `name` property.

```js
const someFunction = function someFunctionName() {};
someFunction.name; // "someFunctionName"
```

Anonymous function expressions created using the keyword `function` or arrow functions would have `""` (an empty string) as their name.

```js
(function () {}).name; // ""
(() => {}).name; // ""
```

However, such cases are rare â€” usually, in order to refer to the expression elsewhere, the function expression is attached to an identifier when it's created (such as in a variable declaration). In such cases, the name can be inferred, as the following few subsections demonstrate.

One practical case where the name cannot be inferred is a function returned from another function:

```js
function getFoo() {
  return () => {};
}
getFoo().name; // ""
```

### Variable declaration and method

Variables and methods can infer the name of an anonymous function from its syntactic position.

```js
const f = function () {};
const object = {
  someMethod: function () {}
};

console.log(f.name); // "f"
console.log(object.someMethod.name); // "someMethod"
```

The same applies to assignment:

```js
let f;
f = () => {};
f.name; // "f"
```

### Initializer and default value

Functions in initializers (default values) of [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#default_value), [default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters), [class fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields), etc., will inherit the name of the bound identifier as their `name`.

```js
const [f = () => {}] = [];
f.name; // "f"

const { someMethod: m = () => {} } = {};
m.name; // "m"

function foo(f = () => {}) {
  console.log(f.name);
}
foo(); // "f"

class Foo {
  static someMethod = () => {};
}
Foo.someMethod.name; // someMethod
```

### Shorthand method

```js
const o = {
  foo() {},
};
o.foo.name; // "foo";
```

### Bound function

[`Function.prototype.bind()`](../../../globals/Function/prototype/bind.mdx) produces a function whose name is "bound " plus the function name.

```js
function foo() {};
foo.bind({}).name; // "bound foo"
```

### Getter and setter

When using [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) and [`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) accessor properties, "get" or "set" will appear in the function name.

```js
const o = {
  get foo() {},
  set foo(x) {},
};

const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, "foo");
descriptor.get.name; // "get foo"
descriptor.set.name; // "set foo";
```

### Class

A class's name follows the same algorithm as function declarations and expressions.

```js
class Foo {}
Foo.name; // "Foo"
```

> **Warning:** JavaScript will set the function's `name` property only if a function does not have an own property called `name`. However, classes' [static members](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static) will be set as own properties of the class constructor function, and thus prevent the built-in `name` from being applied. See [an example](#telling_the_constructor_name_of_an_object) below.

### Symbol as function name

If a `Symbol` is used a function name and the symbol has a description, the method's name is the description in square brackets.

```js
const sym1 = Symbol("foo");
const sym2 = Symbol();

const o = {
  [sym1]() {},
  [sym2]() {},
};

o[sym1].name; // "[foo]"
o[sym2].name; // "[]"
```

### Private property

Private fields and private methods have the hash (`#`) as part of their names.

```js
class Foo {
  #field = () => {};
  #method() {}
  getNames() {
    console.log(this.#field.name);
    console.log(this.#method.name);
  }
}

new Foo().getNames();
// "#field"
// "#method"
```
