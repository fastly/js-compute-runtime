# KVStore.prototype.get

â–¸ **get**(): `string`

Gets the value associated with the key `key` in the KV store.

## Syntax

```js
get(key)
```

### Parameters

- `key` _: string_
  - The key to retrieve from within the KV-store.

### Return value

If the key does not exist in the KV store, this returns a `Promise` which resolves with `null`.

If the key does exist in the KV store, this returns a `Promise` which resolves with an `KVStoreEntry`.

## Description

Send the given message, converted to a string, to this KVStore instance's endpoint.

The `get()` method requires its `this` value to be a [`KVStore`](../KVStore.mdx) object.

If the `this` value does not inherit from `KVStore.prototype`, a [`TypeError`](../../../globals/TypeError/TypeError.mdx) is thrown.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - If the provided `key`:
    - Is any of the strings `""`, `"."`, or `".."`
    - Starts with the string `".well-known/acme-challenge/"`
    - Contains any of the characters `"#?*[]\n\r"`
    - Is longer than 1024 characters

## Examples

In this example we connect to an KV Store named `'files'` and save an entry to the store under the key `'hello'` and then read back the value and return it to the client.

```js
/// <reference types="@fastly/js-compute" />

import { KVStore } from "fastly:kv-store";

async function app(event) {
  const files = new KVStore('files')

  await files.put('hello', 'world')

  const entry = await files.get('hello')

  return new Response(await entry.text())
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(app(event)))

```
