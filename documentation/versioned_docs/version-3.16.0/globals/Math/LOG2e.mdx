# Math.LOG2E

The **`Math.LOG2E`** property represents the base 2 logarithm of [E](./E.mdx), approximately 1.442.

## Value

`1.4426950408889634`

## Description

Because `LOG2E` is a static property of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.LOG2E`, rather than as a property of a `Math` object you created (`Math` is not a constructor).
