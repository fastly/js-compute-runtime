# allowDynamicBackends

The **`allowDynamicBackends()`** function is used to control whether or not Dynamic Backends should be allowed within this Fastly Compute Service.

By default, Dynamic Backends are disabled within a JavaScript application as it can be a potential avenue for third-party JavaScript code to send requests, potentially including sensitive/secret data,  off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not intending, which could be a security issue.

>**Note**: This feature is in disabled by default for Fastly Services. Please contact [Fastly Support](https://support.fastly.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000269711) to request the feature be enabled on the Fastly Services which require Dynamic Backends.

## Syntax

```js
allowDynamicBackends(enabledOrConfig)
```

### Parameters

- `enabledOrConfig` _: boolean_
  - Whether or not to allow Dynamic Backends

or

- `enabledOrConfig` _: object_
  - `connectTimeout` _: number_ _**optional**_
    - Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for a connection to this backend to be established.
    - If exceeded, the connection is aborted and a 503 response will be presented instead.
    - Throws a [`RangeError`](../globals/RangeError/RangeError.mdx) if the value is negative or greater than or equal to 2^32
  - `firstByteTimeout` _: number_ _**optional**_
    - Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the server response to begin after a TCP connection is established and the request has been sent.
    - If exceeded, the connection is aborted and a 503 response will be presented instead.
    - Throws a [`RangeError`](../globals/RangeError/RangeError.mdx) if the value is negative or greater than or equal to 2^32
  - `betweenBytesTimeout` _: number_ _**optional**_
    - Maximum duration in milliseconds that Fastly will wait while receiving no data on a download from a backend.
    - If exceeded, the response received so far will be considered complete and the fetch will end.
    - Throws a [`RangeError`](../globals/RangeError/RangeError.mdx) if the value is negative or greater than or equal to 2^32

### Return value

`undefined`.

## Examples

In this example an implicit Dynamic Backend is created when making the fetch request to [https://www.fastly.com/](https://www.fastly.com/) and the response is then returned to the client.
