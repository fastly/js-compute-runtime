# Device.prototype.hardwareType

The read-only **`hardwareType`** property of the `Device` interface is
either a string stating the hardware type of the device, or `null` if the hardware type is not known.

A string representation of the device's primary platform hardware. The most commonly used device types are also identified via boolean variables. Because a device may have multiple device types and this variable only has the primary type, we recommend using the boolean variables for logic and using this string representation for logging.



## Value

Either a string value if a hardware type is known, otherwise `null`.
