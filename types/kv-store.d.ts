   * Class for accessing a [Fastly KV-store](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/kv-store/).
   *
   * A kv store is a persistent, globally consistent key-value store.
   *
   * **Note**: Can only be used when processing requests, not during build-time initialization.
   * 
   * @example
   * <script async defer src="https://fiddle.fastly.dev/embed.js"></script>
   * In this example we connect to an KV Store named `'files'` and save an entry to the store under the key `'hello'` and then read back the value and return it to the client.
   * 
   * ```js
   * /// <reference types="@fastly/js-compute" />
   * 
   * import { KVStore } from "fastly:kv-store";
   * 
   * async function app(event) {
   *   const files = new KVStore('files')
   * 
   *   await files.put('hello', 'world')
   * 
   *   const entry = await files.get('hello')
   * 
   *   return new Response(await entry.text())
   * }
   * 
   * addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(app(event)))
