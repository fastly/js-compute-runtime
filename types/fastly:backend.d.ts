  /**
   * Class for dynamically creating new [Fastly Backends](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/services/backend/).
   * 
   * @note 
   * This feature is in disabled by default for Fastly Services. Please contact [Fastly Support](https://support.fastly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000269711) to request the feature be enabled on the Fastly Services which require Dynamic Backends.
   *
   * By default, Dynamic Backends are disabled within a JavaScript application as it can be a potential 
   * avenue for third-party JavaScript code to send requests, potentially including sensitive/secret data, 
   * off to destinations that the JavaScript project was not intending, which could be a security issue.
   * 
   * To enable Dynamic Backends the application will need to explicitly allow Dynamic Backends via:
   * ```js
   * import { allowDynamicBackends } from "fastly:experimental";
   * allowDynamicBackends(true);
   * ```
   * 
   * **Note**: Can only be used when processing requests, not during build-time initialization.
   * 
   * @example
   * <script async defer src="https://fiddle.fastly.dev/embed.js"></script>
   * In this example an implicit Dynamic Backend is created when making the fetch request to https://www.fastly.com/ and the response is then returned to the client.
